The National Public Radio in the United States recently commemorated the centennial anniversary of Jascha Heifetz’s American debut at Carnegie Hall. After a quick search, we would like to add a few items of interest from our archives.

Reviews of his debut in several newspapers

> He has a technic which must make him the admiration and the despair of all the other violinists. His finger work is almost unerring, whether in rapid flights or in intricate passages of double stopping. But better than this is the exquisite finish, elasticity and resource of his bowing, which gives him a supreme command of all the tonal nuances essential to style and interpretation.

> Genius is a big word for which there seldom is use. Comparatively few persons are qualified to have it applied to them. Yet one such–a seventeen-year-old Russian youth–stood upon the Carnegie Hall stage yesterday afternoon and before his musical task was half completed an audience numbering more than 2,000, that knew, pronounced him the greatest violinist heard here in years.
