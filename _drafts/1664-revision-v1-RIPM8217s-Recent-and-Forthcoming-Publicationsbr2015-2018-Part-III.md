*Over the past three years, RIPM’s Associate Editor Nicoletta Betta has presented on our then current indexing projects at the annual congress of the International Association of Music Libraries, Archives, and Documentation Centres (IAML). Our team of dedicated staff and collaborators continues to work with remarkable pace and efficiency, upholding the tradition of RIPM’s flagship Retrospective Index, described as “fulfilling a dream of productivity that is virtually unprecedented in the field of music scholarship” (reviewer, National Endowment for the Humanities). And with the recent release of the RIPM Retrospective Index to Music Periodicals with Full Text, a combination of the RIPM Retrospective Index and the RIPM Online Archive to Music Periodicals, users now have access to over 260 rare music journals, 170 of which are available in full-text.*

*In the final installment of our three part series, we provide extracts from Betta’s presentations, highlighting newly indexed journals that are either forthcoming or have been recently published and are now available.*

In 2017, sixteen new journals were indexed—five English, three German, five Italian, one French, and two Spanish—and will be available in the Retrospective Index, along with, in most cases, the full-text of the indexed titles.

In my presentation, I will present basic publication information for all periodicals, the name of the RIPM editor or collaborator responsible for its indexing, and then select one or more for discussion, indicating important features to explain why it was added to the RIPM series. For clarity, the journals are grouped by language of publication.

There are five new English-language titles, spanning the countries of Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Four have been indexed by RIPM’s Senior Editor Richard Kitson and one by our regular collaborator Ruth Henderson.

Included in the five is *The Canon*, RIPM’s first Australian journal. *The Canon* deals with many aspects of Australian musical life, ranging from the activities of institutions such as the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, to a national preoccupation with creating an Australian musical identity. At the same time, this journal also treats European modern music and ethnomusicological issues. The sample table of contents below exemplifies the wide ranging scope of *The Canon*’s interests.

*The Scottish Musical Magazine* was published soon after the end of World War I. Its focus is national, highlighting the music performed and produced in Scotland, as well as regional, giving “serious consideration and publicity to the smallest village whose church choir, amateur orchestral society or choral union is doing credible work”.

Three German-language journals have been indexed by collaborators Peter Sühring and Alexander Staub.

Though published in Germany, *Gravesaner Blätter* documents Hermann Scherchen’s pioneering electroacoustic research at his Experimental Studio in Gravesano, Switzerland. The content of this journal includes reports on congresses held in Gravesano, studies on acoustics, compositional technique, aesthetics, the transmission and perception of sound, as well as the relationship between music and new media. Notable contributors include Iannis Xenakis, Luigi Nono, Pierre Boulez, and Henri Pousseur. Following is a cover page of *Gravesaner Blätter* designed by the well-known architect, Le Corbusier.

The journal *Stimmen* participated in the intellectual rebuilding of Germany after 1945. Published under the authority of the American sector in Berlin, the journal’s editor—influential musicologist, composer, and critic Hans Heinz Stuckenschmidt—chose to emphasize a plurality of opinions related to new music. Contributors include Aaron Copland, Wilhelm Furtwangler, Ernst Krenek, Olivier Messiaen, and Hermann Scherchen.

The indexes to five Italian journals were recently completed; four were produced by RIPM’s collaborator of long standing: Elvidio Surian. I am responsible for the index to *Rassegna Musicale*.

With the addition of *Ricordiana*, RIPM has completed its collection of journals issued by the Milan publishing house, Ricordi. From the first issue of the *Gazzetta musicale di Milano* to the last issue of *Musica d’Oggi*, Ricordi magazines reflected and influenced musical life in Italy and in Europe at large for more than one hundred years. Below are sample cover pages of journals[\[1\]](#_ftn1) published by Ricordi: (L-R) *Gazzetta musicale di Milano* (1842-1862, 1866-1902), *Musica e musicisti* (1902-1905), *Ars et labor* (1906-1912), *Musica d’Oggi* (1919-1942), *Ricordiana* (1951-1957), *Musica d’Oggi* (1958-1965).

RIPM added the French-language journal *Dissonances* (Genève, 1923-1925, 1930-1945, 1946) to its collection this year, indexed by our editor of French periodicals, Doris Pyee.

*Dissonances* was edited by R. Aloys Mooser, a highly influential French Swiss music critic. Rather than publish reviews of musical life, Mooser preferred a format of short, highly critical articles dealing generally with modern music as well as national Swiss music and musicians. Caricatures were also regularly included.

<div style="text-align: center;">Caricatures of Ignacy Jan Paderewski and Arthur Honegger  
<span style="font-size: 70%;">Vol. 2 No. 3 (March 1925): 53; Vol. 1 No. 10 (November 1924): 197.</span></div>Finally, two Spanish-language journals have been indexed by RIPM collaborator Gabriel Caballero, *Nuestra musica* (Mexico City, 1946-1953), now available as an annotated index, and *Musicalia* (La Havana, 1928-1932).

The Cuban journal, *Musicalia*, is concerned with music specifically produced and performed on the island. The opening statement of the first issue reads:

> *Musicalia* is open to all that comes from abroad, but it is deeply bound to the musical activity in Cuba. From the artistic point of view, our country is nowadays in great fermentation and many artistic seeds are germinating.

This journal contains some pioneering studies of Afro-Cuban music, as well as investigations into the potential merging of Afro-Cuban music and European symphonic repertory. This is the subject of several essays, including one by Alejandro Garcia Caturla entitled, “Posibilidades sinfonicas de la musica afrocubana,” (Symphonic Possibilities of Afro-Cuban Music).
