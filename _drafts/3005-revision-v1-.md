In an article entitled, “Toward a Musicology of Interfaces,” Emily Dolan notes that the eighteenth century was a time of significant experimentation in keyboard and piano design.

> …in the eighteenth century, keybord instruments presented a technological “problem.” The search for improvements, however, did more than provide possible solutions to this problem: it helped establish the keyboard as a default interface creating a culture of invention. The “problem” became a universal solution: novel ways of producing sound could be efficiently instrumentalized using the keyboard.

This keyboard “culture of invention” saw further developments in the ninteenth century, particularly as industrialization and mechanization continued to expand throughout Western Europe. At times these inventive keyboards were not even manufactured. Some were caricatures of imagined mash-ups of pianos with the latest technological device. Below are a series of images of these unusual pianos, real and imagined.

First, is a “double piano,” manufactured by the famed piano factory, Pleyel.

A so-called “push-up” player piano, the *Pianista-Thibouville* made use of the typical perforated cardboard used in mechanical pianos. But, this real piano was played by the use of a hand crank, which initiated the mechanical playing of the keys in front of the device.

Below is a caricature of a piano which, when played, makes clothing. “Time to play a quadrille, you get a complete suit. If you only want a coat, you only play the contredanse until you reach the trousers.” (Le temps de jouer un quadrille, on obtient un costume complet. Si l’on veut seulement un habit, on n’exécute la contredanse que jusqu’au pantalon.)

Becoming Pleyel, Wolff, et Cie. in 1853, the piano manufacturing company produced a transposing piano, as shown in this 1874 image.

This caricature imagined what it might look like if one merged a piano, with a camera!
