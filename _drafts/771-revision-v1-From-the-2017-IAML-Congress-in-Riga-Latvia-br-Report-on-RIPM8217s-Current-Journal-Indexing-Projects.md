The 66th Congress of the International Association of Music Libraries, Archives, and Documentation Centres (IAML) was held this summer in Riga, Latvia, in collaboration with the National Library of Latvia (LNB). At the annual gathering, RIPM Associate Editor Nicoletta Betta presented on the progress of our current indexing projects. The twenty-six new journals that have been indexed this year will be available in the Retrospective Index and, in most all cases, in full-text in the Online Archive.

In this presentation summary, we include each new journal’s basic publication information, the name of the RIPM editor or collaborator responsible for its indexing, as well as important features of several publications, to explain, in a certain sense, why it is important to have them included in our archives. For clarity, the journals are grouped according to their language of publication.

The journals printed in English include RIPM’s first Australian journal, *The Canon,* indexed by RIPM Senior Editor Richard Kitson.

*The Canon* followed Australian musical life in its many aspects: from the activities of symphonic institutions like the Sydney Symphony Orchestra to the public demands for an Australian musical identity. Below, an article published in the April 1948 issue asks, “Is an Australian music a possibility?” At the same time, this journal gave new perspectives on European modern music, and included ethnomusicological studies. One such study, published in March 1948, is entitled, “Ancient music of the Australian Aborigine”.

The *Scottish Musical Magazine*, published after the end of World War I, was designed to give the highest relevance to the music performed and produced in Scotland, and to give “serious consideration and publicity to the smallest village whose church choir, amateur orchestral society or choral union is doing credible work”. Below is a photograph taken from the journal of Thomas G. O’Ferly, conductor of the Edinburgh Opera Company.

The journals published in German have been indexed by our esteemed collaborators Peter Sühring and Alexander Staub.

*Gravesaner Blätter* was published in Germany, but documents Hermann Scherchen’s pioneering research in electroacoustics based in his Experimental Studio in Gravesano, near Lugano, Switzerland, inaugurated in 1954. It also includes reports on congresses held in Gravesano, together with studies on acoustics, compositional technique, aesthetics, the transmission and perception of sound, as well as relationships between music and new media. Notable contributors included Iannis Xenakis, Luigi Nono, Pierre Boulez, and Henri Pousseur, among others.

Published a few years before *Gravesaner*, *Stimmen* represents an important contribution to the intellectual rebuilding of Germany after 1945. The title *Stimmen,* or, “Voices,” was intended to emphasize a plurality of opinions related to new music. The journal’s editor was the influential music critic Hans Heinz Stuckenschmidt, and among the contributors were Aaron Copland, Wilhelm Furtwangler, Ernst Krenek, Olivier Messiaen, Hermann Scherchen, and photographed below right, Arnold Schoenberg.

*Musikalisches Kurier*, edited by Max Graf, a pupil of Eduard Hanslick and Anton Bruckner, was founded in a particular cultural and historical moment in the young Republic of Austria. It represents both the desire to save the old values of the German musical culture, and the need for modernity. Below is the cover of the special issue, “Salzburg,” published in August 1921, containing contributions for the realization of the new Salzburg Festival.

The Italian music journals listed below are the result of the work of our very productive collaborator, Elvidio Surian. The only exception is *Rassegna Musicale*, indexed by Nicoletta Betta herself.

With the addition of *Ricordiana* and *Musica d’oggi,* second edition, RIPM will complete its collection of journals issued by the publishing house, Ricordi. Ricordi magazines accompanied and influenced musical life in Italy and Europe for more than one hundred years. Both *Ricordiana* and *Musica d’oggi* represented a new course in Ricordi journals: while their predecessors were mostly informative bulletins, these two magazines evolved towards the status of scholarly journals, focused principally on contemporary music (*Musica d’oggi*) and music education (*Ricordiana*), and welcomed contributions by renowned critics and musicians like Luciano Berio, Wilhelm Furtwangler, Luciano Chailly, and more.

RIPM added two French language journals to its collection this year.

*Sirène* was intended to inform the public on the activities of the journal’s founding group of young Belgian composers, including Albert Huybrechts, Marcel Poot, Fernand Quinet, and André Souris; but also to report on new music produced abroad.

*Dissonances* was edited by R. Aloys Mooser, the most influential music critic of French Switzerland. Mooser wanted to replace the concluded *Gazette Musicale de la Suisse Romande* with a journal characterized by a strong editorial identity. In fact, *Dissonances* refused to give reviews of musical life, preferring a peculiar form of short articles rich in polemical spirit, sometimes sarcastic, dealing generally with national Swiss music, musicians, and their production. Caricatures were regularly included. Above is an unflattering sketch of Polish pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewsky, and a more favorable depiction of Ernest Ansermet, director of the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande.

Another group of journals published in Spanish has been indexed by RIPM collaborator, Gabriel Caballero. These journals were all published in the first half of the 20th-century.

In many of these journals from South and Central America, as well as the Circum-Caribbean, local music institutions, which attracted opera troupes, soloists, and orchestras from Europe, encountered rich folk traditions, creating much debate, but also the birth of new musical genres.

La *Revista de Musica* ‘s main aim was to inform Argentine music amateurs about events happening abroad: the fall of the tonal system and new harmonic theories; the birth of new media, as well as tournées of Western artists visiting Argentina.

 The Cuban journal, *Musicalia,* however, is more concerned about music produced and performed on the island. The opening statement of the first issue reads, “*Musicalia* is open to all the airs that come from abroad, but it is deeply bound to the musical activity in Cuba. From the artistic point of view, our country is nowadays in great fermentation and many artistic seeds are germinating”. This journal includes some pioneering studies of Afro-Cuban music, as well as investigations into the potential merging of Afro-Cuban traditions and European symphonic repertory, like Alejandro Garcia Caturla’s essay, “Posibilidades sinfonicas de la musica afrocubana,” or, “Symphonic Possibilities of Afro-Cuban Music”.

The addition of these new journals is made possible by RIPM’s international staff of dedicated collaborators and editors.
