Good afternoon to everyone, I’m NB, RIPM assistant editor, and I’m here to give you a quick overview on the progress of RIPM Retrospective Index during the last year. The 26 new journals that have been indexed this year will be available on RIPM platform both in the Retrospective Index and in full-text version in the Online Archive.

The addition of all these new journals to RIPM repertory is made possible thanks to RIPM international staff of collaborators and editors, that index the journals according to RIPM guidelines.

I will tell their names together with the titles of journals they have indexed; I will give a list of the journals that are currently in progress or completed in the past year – not yet published – and I will highlight the most important features of someone of these journals, to explain, in a certain sense, why it is important to have them included in RIPM repertory.

I will start with the on-going indexing project on  ***Neue Zeitschrift für Musik***, the well-known German music journal founded by Schumann in 1834 and published until today.

During the last year our German collaborators Peter Suhring and Alexander Staub have been working on the years from 1845 to 1868, the so-called “Brendel years”. In 1845 Franz Brendel bought the journal from Schumann, that wanted to dedicate more time to his activity as a composer. The journal maintained the purposes that Schumann gave it at the very beginning, that’s to say, to reform music journalism and criticism and to represent an alternative to the other important German music journal of that time, the *Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung*. Moreover, with Brendel this journal became the organ of the New German School – Neudeutsche Schule, the name that Brendel himself gave to the musical movement headed by Franz Liszt and Wagner.

Then, a nourished group of 11 American journals, mostly published in NY and indexed by Richard Kitson, Ruth Henderson, Benjamin Knysak, David Sommerfield, Justin Nurin, with the collaboration of Elvidio Surian and me for the Italian section of two of them.

Many of them – the older ones, like ***The Euterpeiad*** (1830-31) and ***Watson’s Art Journal*** (1864-1876) share the same aim: they are journal devoted to European fine art music, and they want to contribute to the creation of an American fine-art musical culture, similar to the European one, but based on American musical traditions. They search for improvement in quality performances and composition, and often they contain poems to be set in music and music supplement intended for the education of the taste of readers.

***Watson’s Art Journal*** takes its name from Henry C. Watson, composer, singer and music critic of the New York Tribune.

***Opera Magazine*** (New York, 1914-1916) of great interest for its rich music iconography, including many photos of American less known opera singers, theatrical stagings and the scenery of operas. Main field of interest of the journal is the birth of an American operatic repertory, and an American school of singers, in search of independence from Europe.

Another interesting couple of journals, published in the second decade of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, is the one made by

***International Music and Drama*** and ***Music and Musicians/ Musica e Musicisti***. Richard Kitson will treat these journals in depth in his presentation; I’ll simply introduce them to you.

They are published both in English and Italian, have contributors of both nationalities, and are intended to give information about Italian music life to the community of Italian immigrants to the US, but also to support the Italian music tradition against the German one that was prevailing at that moment in the US. They also follow the events of 1st World War that was going on in Europe during those years; and the immigration of European singers, musicians and composers, immigration seen as an opportunity for enrichment of American musical life.

Two of the Italian journals indexed this year by Elvidio Surian and me were expressions of influent music publishing houses:

***Musica d’Oggi*** published by casa musicale Ricordi; and ***Musica e Scena*** that was published by the other music editor in Milan, casa musicale Sonzogno. This is another journal very rich in photographic documentation: scenery of operas and operettas and photographic portraits of singers and composers linked to casa Sonzogno and representing the Italian “Giovane scuola” \[Young School\] of composers: Ruggero Leoncavallo, Pietro Mascagni, Umberto Giordano and Giacomo Puccini.

***Incontri Musicali***, published in Milan too, had a short life – only four issues published in the period from 1956 to 1960 – but it collected contributions from the most influent European composers of these years. Founded by Luciano Berio and dedicated to contemporary music research – electronic music, serial music, aleatory music. it contains articles by Henri Pousseur, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Umberto Eco, John Cage.

The three French journals indexed by Doris Pyee were all published during the first half of 20<sup>th</sup> century; they are all three devoted to modern music; two of them – ***Contrepoints*** and ***Polyphonie*** were published immediately after second world war and reflect the great social and cultural changes of that moment of uncertainty.

***Musique*** (Paris, 1927-1930) is continuation of *Revue Pleyel*, edited by musicologist Marc Pincherle. It is mostly about new music and it brings attention to new media, such as recording of contemporary music and radio broadcasts of concerts; and to international musical life, with very rich correspondence from all around the world – in fact, it was one of the first journals to publish correspondence from Japan.

A curious image depicting one of the “Poèmes à l’aiguille”, “Needle poems”, by Suzanne Roland-Manuel, the sister of the music critic; it is a portrait of Ravel made of cloth. She also portrayed with the same technique other French musicians such as Auric and Poulenc, and she also made dolls portraying them.

During this year RIPM also added journals from England, Russia and Mexico, edited by Richard Kitson, Gabriel Caballero, Natalia Ostroumova

***The Meister*** (London, 1888-1894) was the journal of the London branch of the Wagner society;

***El Sonido 13*** (Mexico City and New York, 1924-1927) was founded by the Mexican composer Julian Carrillo, a very interesting musician who was also named for Nobel prize for his studies on acustics and microtones. This journal is dedicated to modern music, especially the Mexican scene, and to struggle against cultural supremacy of European music and musical theory.
