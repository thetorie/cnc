As industrialization and mechanization expanded throughout Western Europe during the nineteenth century, keyboard design followed suit. At times these inventive keyboard experiments were not even manufactured. Some were caricatures of imagined mash-ups of pianos with the latest technological advancement. Below are a series of images of these unusual instruments, real and imagined.

First, is a “double piano,” manufactured by the famed piano factory, Pleyel.

A so-called “push-up” player piano, the *Pianista-Thibouville* made use of the typical perforated cardboard used in mechanical pianos. But, this real piano was played by the use of a hand crank, which initiated the mechanical playing of the keys in front of the device.

Below is a caricature of a piano which, when played, makes clothing. “Time to play a quadrille, you get a complete suit. If you only want a coat, you only play the contredanse until you reach the trousers.” (Le temps de jouer un quadrille, on obtient un costume complet. Si l’on veut seulement un habit, on n’exécute la contredanse que jusqu’au pantalon.)

Becoming Pleyel, Wolff, et Cie. in 1853, the piano manufacturing company produced a transposing piano, as shown in these 1874 images.

This caricature imagined what it might look like if one merged a piano, with a camera!

Finally, inventive keyboards were not solely for musical purposes. The keyboard’s ergonomic design made it easily adaptable for other means. Some, like the Parisian priest Vincenzo Calendoli, utilized the interface to invent early, typewriter-like machines.
