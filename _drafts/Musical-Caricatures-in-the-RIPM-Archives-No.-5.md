Frenchman Eugène Scribe (1791-1861) was a prolific dramatist and librettist, furnishing the text for many of the most popular grand operas of the nineteenth century. His prodigious output was due, in part, to a more formulaic, mechanical model of storytelling. As seen below, for Scribe, “carving-out” a libretto for *Manon Lescaut* was hardly diffcult!
