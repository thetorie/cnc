<span style="font-size: 70%;">CITATION HERE</span></div>This week, we celebrate the birth of the influential Austrian composer, Alban Berg. A longtime student of Arnold Schoenberg, Berg’s compositional style blended modernist twelve-tone and serial techniques—hallmark characteristics of the so-called Second Viennese School—with late 19th-century Romanticism. His first major success was the 1925 avant-garde opera, Wozzeck, derived from an unfinished play by German dramatist Georg Büchner, which told the story of an impoverished soldier’s descent into madness and murder. To commemorate his birth, we present several reflections on Wozzeck written by the composer himself—translated and published in an issue \[Vol. 5 No. 1 (Nov. – Dec. 1927): 22-24.\] of the journal *Modern Music*—accompanied by video excerpts of several memorable scenes from Act III of a 1987 production by the Vienna State Opera, the late Claudio Abbado conducting.
