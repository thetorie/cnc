**Proposed by Marten Noorduin**

Here are a few amusing reflections from the musical press about Ludwig van Beethoven.

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1-beethoven.jpg)<span style="font-size: 10pt;">*La Chronique musicale,* vol. 10 no. 58 (15 November 1875): \[1p\] 166/67.</span>

The American periodical *Dwight’s Journal of Music* published an anecdote about Beethoven that was originally published in the 1860 autobiography of German composer, violinist, and conductor, Louis Spohr:

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2.1-beethoven.jpg)<span style="font-size: 10pt;">*Dwight’s Journal of Music*, vol. 18 no. 22 (2 March 1861): 392.</span>

Other music journals published imaginative illustrations of the composer. *The Baton*, for example, depicted Beethoven and Schubert enjoying a musical evening together in the company of the Viennese artistic society. Although both composers knew of each other, there is no evidence that they ever actually met in person.

However, not all illustrations in reference to Beethoven strike such a reverential tone. The Spanish language periodical, *La Música Ilustrada Hispano-Americana*, published a cartoon in which each movement title of Beethoven’s “Pastoral” Symphony No. 6 is treated to a visual narrative. In order to follow the Spanish-language cartoon, we have included the German and English translations to the movement titles, just in case you need a quick reminder!

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">*La Música Ilustrada Hispano-Americana*, vol. II no. 10 (10 May 1899): 10.</span>

Finally, a comparison of Beethoven portraits reveals how visual artists do much to reinscribe the composer as a quintessential Romantic figure. On the left is how Beethoven was depicted in the French illustrated newsweekly *L’Illustration* in 1893, 66 years after his death; on the right is German caricaturist Franz Eder’s Beethoven depiction in 2009, imagining what the composer would have looked like had he been born two centuries later. The similarities—the furrowed brow, unkempt hair, and disapproving frown—are striking!

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">*L’Illustration,* Vol. CI (27 May 1893): 431; Franz Eber, 2009. <http://www.franz-eder.de/Portraets.shtml></span>
