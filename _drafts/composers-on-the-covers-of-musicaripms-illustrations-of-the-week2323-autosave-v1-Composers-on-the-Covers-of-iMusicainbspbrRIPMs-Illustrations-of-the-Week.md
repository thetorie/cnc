The French journal *Musica* (1902-1914) was published in Paris by the influential journalist and publisher Pierre Lafitte. Perhaps better known for his illustrated sports magazine *La Vie au grand air* (1898-1914; 1916-22), Lafitte’s affinity for illustrations is also evident in *Musica*, which regularly incorporated images of well-known composers and performers with accompanying articles. The journal’s editor, Xavier Leroux, was a composer and longtime teacher of harmony at the Paris Conservatoire.

Today, we present just a sampling of the many attractive illustrated covers of *Musica*.
