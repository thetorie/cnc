*Today marks the 89th birthday of jazz writer, editor, critic, archivist, and producer Dan Morgenstern. The chief editor of* DownBeat *from 1967 to 1973, and a number of other publications, as well as Director of the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers University for over three decades, Morgenstern remains still today a giant in the jazz community.*

*H. Robert Cohen and I (John Ehrenburg) share an affinity for Morgenstern’s writing. And reflecting one day on ways to celebrate the birthday of this remarkable individual and perhaps to introduce his body of work to those less familiar with it, an unorthodox idea came to the fore . . . . quote the final paragraph of some of his many memorable articles.*

*In the first of this two-part series, we feature Morgenstern’s closing thoughts on variety of wide-ranging issues related to jazz. In part two, we will focus on Morgenstern’s profiles of both highly influential and lesser-known jazz musicians.*

On an unidentified Monday evening in April, or perhaps in May 1961, a remarkable gathering took place at the instigation and at the home of Miles Davis. It was organized as a turn-the-tables forum in which well-known performers could pose questions to well-known jazz critics. Among the numerous performers—Horace Silver, “Cannonball” Adderley, Gerry Mulligan, J. J. Johnson, and Gil Evans—among the critics, Dan Morgenstern, Nat Hentoff, Ira Gitler, and Martin Williams.
