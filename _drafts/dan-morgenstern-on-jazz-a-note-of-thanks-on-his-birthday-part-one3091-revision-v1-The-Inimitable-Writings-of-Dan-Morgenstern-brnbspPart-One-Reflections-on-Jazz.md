*Today marks the 89th birthday of jazz writer, editor, critic, archivist, and producer Dan Morgenstern. The chief editor of DownBeat from 1967 to 1973, and a number of other publications, as well as Director of the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers University for over three decades, Morgenstern remains still today a giant in the jazz community.*

*H. Robert Cohen and I (John Ehrenburg) share an affinity for Morgenstern’s writing. And reflecting one day on ways to celebrate the birthday of this remarkable individual and to introduce his body of work to those less familiar with it, an unorthodox idea came to the fore . . . . quote the final paragraph of some of his many memorable articles.*

*In the first of this two-part series, we feature Morgenstern’s closing thoughts on variety of wide-ranging issues related to jazz. In part two, we will focus on Morgenstern’s profiles of both highly influential and lesser-known jazz musicians.*
