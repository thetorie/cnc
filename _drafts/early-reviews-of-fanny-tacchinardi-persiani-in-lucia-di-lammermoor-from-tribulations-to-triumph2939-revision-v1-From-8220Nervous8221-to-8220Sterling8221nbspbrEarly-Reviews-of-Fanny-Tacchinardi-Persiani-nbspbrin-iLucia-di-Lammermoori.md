On this day in 1835, Donizetti’s tragic masterpiece *Lucia di Lammermoor* premiered at the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples, Italy*.* Singing the title role was Italian soprano Fanny Tacchinardi Persiani (1812-1867).

Tacchinardi Persiani received much attention in the musical press for her creation of the role of Lucia. Tracking the reception of her appearances in the work’s premiere at the Venetian Teatro Apollo, Parisian Théâtre-Italien, and London’s Her Majesty’s Theater, shows how the soprano moved from some initially nerve-wracked renditions, to consistently stellar performances.

An extensive review of several performances of *Lucia di Lammermoor* at the Venetian Teatro Apollo*,* including the 1837 Venice premiere, raised some questions about Tacchinardi Persiani’s composure.

> Another understandable insult to fortune was the presence in Tachinardi’s spirit of an uncontrollable nervousness…\[This was\] produced by her concern about the great task of meriting the reputation that she, in her modesty, has depicted as exaggerated.

Tacchinardi Persiani’s trepidation should come as no surprise to those familiar with the role of Lucia, as it remains one of the most challenging in the entire repertory. In the following video, soprano Lisette Oropesa demonstrates just what makes singing this role so difficult.

<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NYm7oJXVeks?rel=0&start=1" width="560"></iframe></div>In the review of the Venice premiere, one reads that the soprano’s Mad Scene “did not rise to the level of her reputation” (non si alzò al livello della sua rinomanza nell’aria), but, as the review continues, Tacchinardi Persiani appears to have improved dramatically in subsequent performances.

> …that aria which she had performed ineffectively, struck the audience with such surprise that they were constrained to applaud the cabaletta most enthusiastically, and \[gave\] its repetition a most resounding reception, and then demanded that she take a curtain call. To such an extent has she risen in the public’s esteem.

<div>In December 1837, Tacchinardi Persiani premiered the role of Lucia in Paris at the Théâtre-Italien. The soprano received positive reviews, though interestingly, a London correspondent from *The Musical World* also notes that, as in Venice, the quality of her singing improved with each performance.

By the time *Lucia di Lammermoor* made its way to London, premiering in April 1838, Tacchinardi Persiani had firmly established herself in the role. This time, in a report entitled, “A Galaxy of Talent,” a New York correspondent for the *The Musical Review* reported from London on her stellar performances at Her Majesty’s Theater:

</div>There are of course no recordings of Fanny Tacchinardi Persiani’s performance, but the longstanding popularity of *Lucia di Lammermoor* has obviously led to numerous recordings of prominent sopranos past and present taking on the role. Listen then to forty-nine of them singing the high Eb in the famous aria from the Mad Scene, “Spargi D’amaro Pianto.” Which rendition is your favorite?
