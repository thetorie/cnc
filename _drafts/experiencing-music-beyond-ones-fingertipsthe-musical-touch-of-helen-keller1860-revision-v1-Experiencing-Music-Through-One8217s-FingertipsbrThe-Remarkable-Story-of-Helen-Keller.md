Occupying considerable attention in the journal *Musical America* during the 1910s are reports on the musical listening experiences of American Helen Keller, a leading 20th-century author, political activist, lecturer, and champion of the disabled. She was also deaf and blind as a result of a childhood illness. In the spring of 1916, tenor Enrico Caruso gave a private performance for Keller.

The placement of Keller’s fingers on Caruso’s lips achieved a mode of musical listening predominantly based on touch. The brief report in *Musical America,* however, promoted the misconception that hearing necessitates authentic musical experience. By publishing the tactile encounter with Caruso’s voice as having “heard” and “listened” (with quotations) rather than heard or listened (without quotations), the report privileged the ears as the superior musical sensory organ, and incorrectly reduced Keller’s genuine musical experience as less than that of an able-bodied person. For Keller, touch was a powerful faculty that extended well-beyond the perceived limits of the finger-tips:

> I think people do not usually realize what an extensive apparatus the sense of touch is. It is apt to be confined in our thoughts to the finger-tips. In reality, the tactual sense reigns throughout the body, and the skin of every part, under the urge of necessity, becomes extraordinarily discriminating. It is approximately true to say that every particle of the skin is a feeler which touches and is touched, and the contact enables the mind to draw conclusions regarding the qualities revealed by tactual sensation, such as heat cold, pain, friction, smoothness, and roughness, and the vibrations which play upon the surface of the body.

Below are more accounts, both by those in the musical press and by Keller herself, reporting on her tactile encounters with music. The public’s fascination with Keller’s musical experiences continued to reflect the clashing of both ableist skepticism and the advocacy for alternative musical experiences by this remarkable women.

Fortunately, there is also video documentation of Keller, this time listening to the opera singer Gladys Swarthout.
