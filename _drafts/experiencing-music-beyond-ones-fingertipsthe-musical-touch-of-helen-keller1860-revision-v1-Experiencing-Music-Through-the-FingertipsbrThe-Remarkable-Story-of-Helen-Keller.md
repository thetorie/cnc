Occupying considerable attention in the journal *Musical America* during the 1910s are reports on the musical listening experiences of American Helen Keller, a leading 20th-century author, political activist, lecturer, and champion of the disabled. She was also born deaf and blind. In the spring of 1916, tenor Enrico Caruso gave a private performance for Keller.

Keller’s tactile method of musical listening clashed with the assumption that conventional hearing necessitates authentic musical experience. This misconception is why those writing in *Musical America* described Keller’s encounter with Caruso’s voice as having “heard” and “listened” (with quotations) rather than heard or listened (without quotations). On one hand, this presented Keller’s musical experiences as public spectacle, but, on the other hand, allowed her to advocate for alternative musical experiences. Below are more accounts, both by those in the musical press and by Keller herself, reporting on her encounters with music.

Fortunately, there is also video documentation of Keller, this time listening to the opera singer Gladys Swarthout.
