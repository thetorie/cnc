Proposed by Marten Noorduin

Here are a few amusing reflections from the contemporary musical press about George Frideric Handel.

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/5-AMJ.jpg)<span style="font-size: 10pt;">*The American Musical Journal,* Vol. 1 No. 1 (1 October 1834): \[1\]/1.</span>

A corpulent man, Handel’s love of food and drink was a common subject of anecdotes. Some journals published accounts portraying the composer’s victual indulgences as acts of gluttony and greed.

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1.2-Eut-final.jpg)<span style="font-size: 10pt;">*The Euterpeiad, or Musical Intelligencer,* Vol. 1 No. 39, (23 December 1820): 156.</span>

Interestingly, this particular anecdote from *The Euterpeiad* is quite similar to one published two years later in a book entitled *Anecdotes, Biographical Sketches and Memoirs* by English novelist Laetitia-Matilda Hawkins. In this version, the “friend of Handel” is painter and engraver Joseph Goupy. “Enraged” that Handel stowed away a table of delicacies for himself, Goupy soon after created a piece of art “in which Handel figures as a hog in the midst of dainties.”[\[1\]](#_ftn1) Known as “The charming Brute,” this depiction of Handel sitting at the organ surrounded by items of personal decadence has several iterations. The London journal [*Concordia*](http://ripm.org/?page=JournalInfo&ABB=CNC) (1875-1876) produced a facsimile of one of the engravings.

Two other versions of Goupy’s scathing illustration of Handel contain many similarities: the wine cask organ bench, the lavish meats hanging from the organ, and the composer’s hoggish features.

Anecdotes about Handel also memorialized the composer’s sharp wit, sharper tongue, and, at times, bouts of irritability. The tale below tells of what might have happened if Handel reviewed someone else’s composition.

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/3-musical-journal.jpg)<span style="font-size: 10pt;">*The Musical Journal,* Vol. 2 No. 36 (8 September 1840): 150.</span>

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/11-MHE.jpg)<span style="font-size: 10pt;">*The Musical Herald,* Vol. 6 No. 3 (March 1885): 56.</span>

Those questioning the composer’s own musical decisions were subjected to perhaps worse vitriol.

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2-Eut.jpg)<span style="font-size: 10pt;">*The Euterpeiad, or Musical Intelligencer*, Vol. 1, No. 32 (4 November 1820): 128.</span>

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/10-HAR.jpg)<span style="font-size: 10pt;">*The Harmonicon,* Vol. 1 No. 9 (September 1823): \[1p\] 116/117.</span>

Finally, as the anecdote below details, Handel’s propensity for criticism was apparently not only limited to others, but also to himself.

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/4.2-MWO.jpg)<span style="font-size: 10pt;">*The Musical World*, Vol. 38 No. 27 (7 July 1860): 435.</span>
