*Our scene opens with the* PROFESSOR *beginning one of his tri-weekly music history lectures. It is early September, and morale is high. The* STUDENTS*,* *miraculously, are all on time.*

PROFESSOR leans casually alongside the right of his podium.

PROFESSOR  
“Class, today is the 227<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the birth of  
Giacomo Meyerbeer, one of the most celebrated and  
important composers of opera in the nineteenth century.”

The majority of the students immediately raise their hands, all to ask the same question. PROFESSOR motions to one of the students**.**

PROFESSOR  
“Yes?”

STUDENT ONE  
“Professor, who is Giacomo Meyerbeer”

PROFESSOR, freezes, his face expressing incredulity.

PROFESSOR  
“What?!”

STUDENT ONE  
“Huh?”

PROFESSOR *regains his composure, and asks…*

PROFESSOR  
“Who here has heard of the name Giacomo Meyerbeer?”

*The hall is silent. This time, no hands are raised.* PROFESSOR, *with a coy half-grin, senses the moment at hand.*

PROFESSOR  
“Well, instead of telling you about him,  
why don’t I show you using RIPM.”

STUDENTS *look confused.*

STUDENTS  
(together)  
“RIPM? What’s RIPM?”

PROFESSOR smiles as he presses start on his computer and projector.

PROFESSOR  
<span style="color: #ff0000;">“RIPM provides access online to rare, primary</span>  
source music periodicals and a view of musical life as seen by those who lived it for more than 200 years from Bach to Bernstein.  
RIPM’s databases offer access to over 300  
rare music journals and more than 1,100,000 full-text pages. Just imagine  
the immense possibilities for original research.”

The STUDENTS are wide-eyed and extremely impressed. One calls out.

STUDENT TWO  
“So, how do we search for Meyerbeer?”

PROFESSOR smiles, and opens for display RIPM Retrospective Index with Full Text.

PROFESSOR  
“Expect to be overwhelmed with the results. For, as you can see,  
there are 9,763 annotated records in RIPM with Full Text, and,  
over 24,426 references to the composer in the RIPM  
European and North American Music Periodicals. In fact, Meyerbeer was so popular that his opera *Les Huguenots* (1836) was the first opera ever to be performed at the Paris Opéra  
more than 1,000 times.”

STUDENTS  
(collectively)  
“Good grief! What are we suppose to do with all of this!”

PROFESSOR  
“Magic phrase here is: B O O L E A N delimiters! (Be prepared to define it in your next exam.)  
With boolean, you can easily refine your search results.  
Now let’s look for illustrations of the composer”

“First, we’ll access RIPM with Full Text.

Then, select Advanced Search.  
In the Keyword(s) Field, enter “Meyerbeer.”  
In the Type field, select “Illustration.”

PROFESSOR clicks “Search” and glances up at the lecture hall.

PROFESSOR  
“As you see, in RIPM with Full Text alone, there are 28 illustrations of Meyerbeer.”

STUDENT THREE  
(calling out)  
“You mean, RIPM does all this work for us?”

PROFESSOR smiles and nods knowingly.

STUDENT THREE high-fives student next to him. PROFESSOR notes that two students, previously dozing off, suddenly wake up.

STUDENT  
“You mean, I could search for “Meyerbeer and Shakespeare, or Meyerbeer and Wagner?”

PROFESSOR  
“Yes, and your searches are only limited by your imagination.”

“Now, returning to our initial Meyerbeer illustrations search, let’s click on the first record, which brings up the full-text reader and…a lovely lithograph of Meyerbeer published in 1825 in *The Harmonicon.”*

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meyerbeer-1.jpg)  
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">*The Harmonicon,* Vol. 3 No. 31 (July 1825): \[1p\] 118/119. </span>

\*\*\*

STUDENTS  
(together, stunned)  
“Oooooooooo!”

PROFESSOR  
“Clicking on the next citation reveals another lithograph, this one  
published in 1836 in the *Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung*, perhaps the  
most influential German music journal of the early nineteenth century.”

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meyerbeer-AMZ-1.jpg)*<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung,</span>*<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Vol. 37 supplementary page(s) (January 1836): \[1\] 872/1. </span>

\*\*\*

STUDENTS  
(together, with surprise)  
“Ahhhhhhhhhh!”

PROFESSOR  
“The next illustration is from a French journal, *La Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris.”*

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meyerbeer-RGM.jpg)<span style="font-size: 8pt;">*La Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris,* Vol. 5 No. 44 (4 November 1838): \[1p\] 448/449.</span>

\*\*\*

STUDENTS become increasingly curious, which you can see in their faces.

PROFESSOR  
“So we’ve already seen an illustration from an English, German,  
and French journal. Now here’s one from an Italian journal.”

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meyerbeer-STE.jpg)<span style="font-size: 8pt;">*Strenna Teatrale Europea,* Vol. 3 No. 2 (1840): \[1p\] 35/36. </span>

\*\*\*

STUDENTS are almost speechless.

PROFESSOR  
“As you review your search results, you will find that the 28 illustrations span Meyerbeer’s entire career. This illustration, for example, depicts Meyerbeer in his later years.”

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meyerbeer-RM.jpg)<span style="font-size: 8pt;">*La Revue musicale,* Vol. 4 No. 2 (15 January 1904): 61. </span>

\*\*\*

PROFESSOR  
“Now that we’ve indelibly imprinted in your memory the maestro’s  
physiognomy, let’s look at a few images related to his operas.”

STUDENTS, now properly adjusted to RIPM’s seemingly endless amount of rich primary source materials, look on with wonderment.

PROFESSOR  
“Meyerbeer’s operas were extremely popular and much appreciated for their staging and scenery”

STUDENT ONE  
(calling out)  
“Well, that’s interesting, but what did these lavish productions look like?”

PROFESSOR continues.

PROFESSOR  
“This question is particularly pertinent right now because RIPM  
is about to add to its full-text database 3,500 engravings published  
in *L’Illustration*, France’s first illustrated newsweekly. Some of them  
offer a glimpse into the opulent productions of several of Meyerbeer’s  
grand operas during the height of their popularity. For example, here’s an engraving depicting the coronation scene in the Münster Cathedral from Act IV of the premiere of *Le prophète* (1849). ![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meyerbeer-proph-1024x870.jpg)<span style="font-size: 8pt;">*L’Illustration*, Vol. XIII (28 April 1849): 131.</span>

PROFESSOR  
“When viewing this illustration and listening simultaneously to the famous Coronation March  
from this scene, one begins to get a sense of just  
how “grand”a Meyerbeer opera must have been!”

<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AAL07HzblPI?rel=0&start=1&end=197" width="560"><span class="mce_SELRES_start" data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;">﻿</span></iframe></div>STUDENTS look on in amazement.

PROFESSOR checks watch, thinking, “time flies when you’re molding minds.”

PROFESSOR  
“We have just a few more minutes. So let’s look at just two more  
engravings, both from Meyerbeer’s *L’Africaine* (1865), which deals with the fictitious  
events of Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama.  
It was premiered one year after Meyerbeer’s death, in 1864.”

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meyerbeer-Africaine-1-1024x643.jpg)<span style="font-size: 8pt;">*L’Illustration*, Vol. XLV (6 May 1865): 281.</span>

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meyerbeer-Africaine-2-1024x789.jpg)

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Ibid.</span>

\*\*\*

STUDENT FIVE  
“It’s hard to believe that these engravings are of  
an opera stage. They look like scenes from movies!”

PROFESSOR  
“This is why it is known as “grand” opera; the sheer spectacle  
contributed to its popularity, and to the success of this lecture.“

The STUDENTS laugh collectively.

PROFESSOR  
“As you now know, these illustrations offer only a glimpse into what RIPM has to offer  
on Meyerbeer.”

“And now that you know how RIPM functions, your next assignment should not be a difficult one. For next week, please write a ten-page essay on a topic of your choosing concerning Giacomo Meyerbeer.”

The PROFESSOR tightens his grip on the podium anticipating low, audible grumbles from the dark corners of the lecture hall. What a pleasant surprise when he hears this…

STUDENT ONE  
(calling out)  
“Now that we know about RIPM, can we make it fifteen pages?”

PROFESSOR is overcome with emotion. His eyes well up.

PROFESSOR  
“Ok, fifteen pages it is.”

STUDENTS collectively cheer.

PROFESSOR  
“And next week, you can look forward to learning about  
Berlioz and Meyerbeer, about Wagner and Meyerbeer, Verdi and Meyerbeer, about  
the latter’s instrumentation and orchestration, the construction of his large scale scenes,  
his inventive harmonic language, and that, in just the first fifteen  
minutes of the next class. See you on Wednesday.”
