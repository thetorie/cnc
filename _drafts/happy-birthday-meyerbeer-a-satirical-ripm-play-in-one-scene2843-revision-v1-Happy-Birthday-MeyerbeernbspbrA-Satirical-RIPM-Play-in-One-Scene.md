*Our scene opens with the* PROFESSOR *beginning one of his tri-weekly music history lectures. It is early September, and morale is high. The* STUDENTS*,* *miraculously, are all on time.*

PROFESSOR *leans casually alongside the right of his podium.*

PROFESSOR  
“Class, this week marks the 227<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the birth of  
Giacomo Meyerbeer, one of the most celebrated and  
important composers of opera in the nineteenth century.”

*The majority of the students immediately raise their hands, all to ask the same question.* PROFESSOR *motions to one of the students***.**

PROFESSOR  
“Yes?”

STUDENT ONE  
“Professor, who is Giacomo Meyerbeer”

PROFESSOR*, freezes, his face expressing incredulity.*

PROFESSOR  
“What?!”

STUDENT ONE  
“Huh?”

PROFESSOR *regains his composure, and asks…*

PROFESSOR  
“Who here has heard of the name Giacomo Meyerbeer?”

*The hall is silent. This time, no hands are raised.* PROFESSOR, *with a coy half-grin, senses a singular opportunity for a pedagogical moment of hallmark importance.*

PROFESSOR  
“Well, instead of telling you about him,  
why don’t I show you using RIPM.”

STUDENTS *look confused.*

STUDENTS  
(together)  
“RIPM? What’s RIPM?”

PROFESSOR *smiles as he presses “start” on his computer and projector.*

PROFESSOR  
“RIPM provides access online to rare, primary  
source music periodicals and a view of musical life  
as seen by those who lived it for more than 200 years,  
from Bach to Bernstein. As written in RIPM’s promotional  
materials, its databases offer access to over 300 music  
journals and more than 1,100,000 full-text pages. Just  
imagine the immense possibilities for original research.”

STUDENTS *are wide-eyed and extremely impressed. One calls out.*

STUDENT TWO  
“So, how does this RIPM thing work, and  
what’s Meyerbeer have to do with it?”

PROFESSOR *smiles, opens for display RIPM’s databases, and enters Meyerbeer in the keyword search field.*

PROFESSOR  
“Expect to be overwhelmed with the results. For, as you can see,  
there are 9,763 annotated records in RIPM with Full Text, and,  
over 24,426 references to the composer in the RIPM European and  
North American Music Periodicals. In fact, Meyerbeer was so popular  
that his opera *Les Huguenots* (1836) was the first opera ever to  
be performed at the Paris Opéra more than 1,000 times.”

STUDENTS  
(collectively)  
“Good grief! What are we suppose to do with all of this!”

PROFESSOR  
“The magic phrase here is: B O O L E A N operators!  
Be prepared to define it in your next exam. With boolean,  
you can easily refine your search results. Now, let’s take an  
example, and look for illustrations of the composer.”

“First, we’ll access RIPM with Full Text.  
Then, select Advanced Search.  
In the Keyword(s) Field, enter “Meyerbeer.”  
In the Type field, select “Illustration.”

PROFESSOR *clicks “Search” and glances up at the lecture hall.*

PROFESSOR  
“As you see, in RIPM with Full Text alone,  
there are 28 illustrations of Meyerbeer.”

STUDENT THREE  
(calling out)  
“You mean, RIPM does all this work for us?”

PROFESSOR *smiles and nods knowingly.*

STUDENT THREE *high-fives student next to him.*  PROFESSOR *notes that two students, previously dozing off, suddenly wake up.*

STUDENT FOUR  
“You mean, I could search for “Meyerbeer  
and Verdi, or Meyerbeer and Wagner?”

PROFESSOR  
“Yes; your searches are only limited by your imagination.”

“Now, returning to our initial Meyerbeer illustrations search,  
let’s click on the first record, which brings up a lovely lithograph  
of Meyerbeer published in 1825 in *[The Harmonicon](https://ripm.org/index.php?page=JournalInfo&ABB=HAR).”*

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meyerbeer-1.jpg)<span style="font-size: 8pt;">*The Harmonicon,* Vol. 3 No. 31 (July 1825): \[1p\] 118/119. </span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">\* \* \*</span>

STUDENTS  
(together, stunned)  
“Oooooooooo!”

PROFESSOR  
“Clicking on the next citation reveals another lithograph, this one  
published in 1836 in the [*Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung*](https://ripm.org/index.php?page=JournalInfo&ABB=ALZ), one of the  
most influential German music journal of the early nineteenth century.”

*<span style="font-size: 8pt;">![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meyerbeer-AMZ-1.2.jpg)Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung,</span>*<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Vol. 37 supplementary page(s) (January 1836): \[1\] 872/1. </span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">\* \* \*</span>

STUDENTS  
(together, with surprise)  
“Wow!”

PROFESSOR  
“The next illustration is from a French journal, *[Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris](https://ripm.org/index.php?page=JournalInfo&ABB=RGM).”*

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meyerbeer-RGM.jpg)<span style="font-size: 8pt;">*La Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris,* Vol. 5 No. 44 (4 November 1838): \[1p\] 448/449.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">\* \* \*</span>

STUDENTS *become increasingly curious, which you can see in their faces.*

PROFESSOR  
“So we’ve already seen an illustration from an  
English, German, and French journal. Now here’s  
one from an Italian journal, [*Strenna Teatrale Europea*](https://ripm.org/index.php?page=JournalInfo&ABB=STE).”

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meyerbeer-STE.jpg)<span style="font-size: 8pt;">*Strenna Teatrale Europea,* Vol. 3 No. 2 (1840): \[1p\] 35/36. </span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">\* \* \*</span>

STUDENTS *are almost speechless.*

PROFESSOR  
“As you review your search results, you will  
find that the 28 illustrations span Meyerbeer’s  
entire career. This illustration published in the [*Revue musicale*](https://ripm.org/index.php?page=JournalInfo&ABB=RMU)  
for example, depicts Meyerbeer in his later years.”

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meyerbeer-RM.jpg)<span style="font-size: 8pt;">*La Revue musicale,* Vol. 4 No. 2 (15 January 1904): 61. </span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">\* \* \*</span>

PROFESSOR  
“Now that we’ve indelibly imprinted in your  
memory the maestro’s physiognomy, let’s  
look at a few images related to his operas.”

STUDENTS, *now properly adjusted to RIPM’s seemingly endless amount of rich primary source materials, look on with wonderment.*

PROFESSOR  
“Meyerbeer’s operas were extremely popular and  
much appreciated for their staging and scenery”

STUDENT ONE  
(calling out)  
“Well, that’s interesting, but what did  
these lavish productions look like?”

PROFESSOR *continues.*

PROFESSOR  
“Fortunately, some of the 3,350 engravings dealing with music that  
appeared in *L’Illustration*, France’s first illustrated newsweekly, offer  
a glimpse into the opulent productions of Meyerbeer’s grand operas  
during the height of their popularity in Paris. For example, here’s  
an engraving depicting the Coronation Scene in the Münster Cathedral  
from Act IV of the premiere of *Le Prophète* (1849).”

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meyerbeer-proph-1024x870.jpg)<span style="font-size: 8pt;">*L’Illustration*, Vol. XIII (28 April 1849): 131.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">\* \* \*</span>

PROFESSOR  
“When viewing this illustration and listening  
simultaneously to the famous Coronation March  
from this scene, one begins to get a sense of just  
how “grand” a Meyerbeer opera must have been!”

PROFESSOR *checks watch, thinking, “time flies when you’re molding minds.”*

PROFESSOR  
“We have only a few more minutes. So let’s look at just two more  
engravings, that also appeared in *L’Illustration,* of scenes from Meyerbeer’s  
*L’Africaine* (1865), which deals with the fictitious events of Portuguese explorer  
Vasco de Gama. It was premiered one year after Meyerbeer’s death, in 1864.”

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meyerbeer-Africaine-1-1024x643.jpg)<span style="font-size: 8pt;">*L’Illustration*, Vol. XLV (6 May 1865): 281.</span>

<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zYYrmQRuJbU?rel=0&start=1&end=107" width="560"></iframe></div>![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meyerbeer-Africaine-2-1024x789.jpg)<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Ibid.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">\* \* \*</span>

STUDENT FIVE  
“It’s hard to believe that these engravings are of  
an opera stage. They look like scenes from movies!”

PROFESSOR  
“The sheer spectacle was an integrated and expected part of  
the French grand opera experience, as was the success of this lecture.“

STUDENTS *laugh collectively.*

PROFESSOR  
“As you now know, these illustrations offer only a  
glimpse into what RIPM has to offer on Meyerbeer.”  
“And now that you know how RIPM functions, your  
next assignment should not be a difficult one.”

“For next week, please write a ten-page essay on a topic of your  
choosing related to Meyerbeer based on your research in RIPM.”

The PROFESSOR *tightens his grip on the podium anticipating low, audible grumbles from the dark corners of the lecture hall. But what he hears instead pleasantly surprises him…*

STUDENT ONE  
(calling out)  
“Now that we know about RIPM, can we make it fifteen pages?”

PROFESSOR *is overcome with emotion. His eyes well up.*

PROFESSOR  
“Ok, fifteen pages it is.”

STUDENTS *collectively cheer.*

PROFESSOR  
“And next week, you can look forward to learning about  
Berlioz and Meyerbeer, about Wagner and Meyerbeer,  
Verdi and Meyerbeer, about the latter’s instrumentation  
and orchestration, the construction of his large scale scenes,  
his inventive harmonic language, and all of this in just the first  
fifteen minutes of the next class. See you on Wednesday.”

FIN

**RIPM search tip:** RIPM is currently scanning some 3,350 engravings dealing with music that appeared between 1843 and 1899 in *L’Illustration*, France’s first illustrated newsweekly. RIPM plans to make them freely available, via its website. This undertaking is deeply indebted to the ground breaking three-volume publication, *Les Gravures Musicales dans L’Illustration* (Québec, 1983), by H. Robert Cohen, Sylvia L’Écuyer (Lacroix) and Jacques Léveillé, published under the auspices of RIdIM, with a preface by Barry S. Brook. The availability of the images will be announced in a future *Curio*.
