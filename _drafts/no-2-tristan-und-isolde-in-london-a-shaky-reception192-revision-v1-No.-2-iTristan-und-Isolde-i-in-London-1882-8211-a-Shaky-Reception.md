 \[*Il Teatro illustrato* I, no. 3 (March 1881): 5\]

This year marks the 150th anniversary of the first performance of *Tristan und Isolde* (1865). While now accepted as a masterpiece, critics at first performances were not always complimentary. On September 16, 1876, a letter to the editor of *The Musical World* gave a scathing and strident condemnation of Wagner’s work, deploring the discordant harmonies and lack of melody in a review titled “The Wagner Epidemic” (excerpts below):

\[*The Musical World* 54, no. 38 (September 16, 1876): 623\]

Six years later, on June 24, 1882, four days after the London premiere of *Tristan und Isolde*, *The Musical World* published this caricature, supporting the opinion initially expressed. It depicts James William Davison, editor of *The Musical World*, reacting to the “*Tristan* chord*.”* [![WagnerListenerOpening](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WagnerListenerOpening-159x300.jpg)](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WagnerListenerOpening.jpg)

\[*The Musical World* 60, no. 25 (June 24, 1882): 385\]

One month later on July 1, 1882, a much more nuanced and somewhat favorable view emerges.[![PositiveTristanReviewExcerpt](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PositiveTristanReviewExcerpt1-300x181.jpg)](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PositiveTristanReviewExcerpt1.jpg)

\[*The Musical World* 60, no. 26 (July 1, 1882): 395-96\]

However, the journal also underscored the difficulties in performing this work. One week later *The Musical World* published on July 8, 1882 these two caricatures by Charles Lyall — the first depicting the conductor Hans Richter during a rehearsal of *Tristan* and the second, his appearance after the first performance.

\[*The Musical World* 60, no. 27 (July 8, 1882): 415\]

The following two French caricatures were reproduced in *Musical America* on February 12, 1910. The first one (bottom left), an 1869 caricature by Andre Gill, expresses a similar view as Wagner ‘worked’ “on the eardrum of his contemporaries.” The second (bottom right) illustrates the effect of a performance of a Wagner opera.

The past was not always kind to Music of the Future.

In honor of the 150th anniversary of *Tristan und Isolde*, here is an arrangement of “Happy Birthday” in a style we think you will recognize.

And finally, one of the earliest recordings of the Prelude (1932), conducted by Arturo Toscanini two years after he conducted a performance at Bayreuth, the first by a non-German musician.
