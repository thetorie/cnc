\[*The Baton* III, no. 3 (December, 1923): 13\] \[*The Baton* V, no. 3 (December, 1925): 1\]

To celebrate the holiday season, we turn to the December 1925 issue of *The Baton* (New York, 1922-1932). The following article, “Glimpses of Christmas: From the Correspondence of Great Musicians” shows how some celebrated nineteenth-century musicians “of the past spent Christmas” as illustrated through their correspondence and diaries.

Read the article below to see how Robert Schumann, Jenny Lind, Hans von Bülow, Johannes Brahms, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner and others celebrated Christmas and the holiday season. (Click on each image to zoom in.)
