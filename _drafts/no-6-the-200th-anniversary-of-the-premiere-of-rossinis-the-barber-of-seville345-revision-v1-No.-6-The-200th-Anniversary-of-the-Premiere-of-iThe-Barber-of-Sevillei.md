Two hundred years ago today, Giaochino Rossini’s opera *Il Barbiere di Siviglia* (The Barber of Seville) was premiered in Rome on February 20, 1816. The performance was reportedly a “stormy one” full of mishaps such as instrument strings breaking, a cast member falling on his nose, and an errant cat walking across the stage (see below). On top of this, hisses erupted from audience members who were friends of Giovanni Paisiello, voicing their displeasure that the upstart Rossini dared write an opera based on the same libretto as Master Paisiello. Luckily for Rossini, the next evening’s performance was a success.

Almost a hundred years late, the “failure” was explained this way:

The opera’s success was such that by 19 September 1821 it was arranged by Castil-Blaze using a different libretto. That Castil-Blaze was compensated and not Rossini led to a public outcry and the sculptor Dantan *Jeune* to depict Castile-Blaze hanging on the shoulders of Rossini.

The U.S. premiere of *Il Barbiere di Siviglia* took place nice years later at Park Theatre in New York City on November 29, 1825. It was the first opera ever to be sung in Italian (i.e. a foreign language) in America thereby making theatrical history. The celebrated tenor Manuel Garcia created the role of Almaviva in Rome and repeated it in New York, while his young daughter Maria, sang Rosina, and his wife, the role of Bertha. The following articles announced the event:

Rossini’s opera was so popular, that it regularly spawned the creation of numerous transcriptions wherever it was performed, permitting music lovers to surround themselves at home with Rossini’s well-known melodies. Here are two examples from the contemporary press in London that pass in review to British transcriptions.

The popularity of The *Barber of Seville* has continued to grow and today it is one of the most performed operas. Some of us may recall the famous Warner Brothers Looney Tunes’ parody of the opera seen in the cartoon short, “Rabbit of Seville” (1950). For those who don’t, you’re in for a treat…

Finally, a 1925 recording of the celebrated baritone Riccardo Stracciari singing an excerpt from “Largo al Factorum,” from *The Barber of Seville*. We think it’s a “knockout”.
