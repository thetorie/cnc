Both Paisiello and Rossini wrote operas based on Beaumarchais’ comedy *The Barber of Seville*. \[From *left to right*: Paisiello, by Marie Louise Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun, 1791 / Gioachino Rossini, by Vincenzo Camuccini, c. 1815\].

Two hundred years ago today, Giaochino Rossini’s opera *Il Barbiere di Siviglia* was premiered in Rome on February 20, 1816. The performance was reportedly a “stormy one” full of mishaps such as instrument strings breaking, a cast member falling on his nose, and an errant cat walking across the stage (see below). On top of this, hisses erupted from audience members who were friends of Giovanni Paisiello, voicing their displeasure that the upstart Rossini dared write an opera based on the same source as Maestro Paisiello. Luckily for Rossini, the next evening’s performance was a success.

Almost a hundred years later, the so-called “failure” was explained as follows:

The opera’s success was such that by 19 September 1821 it was performed in a French version by Castil-Blaze. He was payed for his efforts; Rossini was not. This led to a public outcry and the sculptor Dantan *Jeune* to depict, in a caricature-statuette, Castil-Blaze riding on Rossini’s back.

\[Dantan *Jeune*, 1833. “XXX” is the manner in which Castil-Blaze, also a music critic, signed some of his articles.\]

The U.S. premiere of *Il Barbiere di Siviglia* took place at The Park Theatre in New York City on November 29, 1825, nine years after the opera’s premiere. It was the first Italian opera performed in a foreign language in New York City, thereby making theatrical history. The celebrated tenor Manuel García who created the role of Almaviva in Rome, repeated it in New York, while his young daughter Maria, sang Rosina, and his wife Joaquina, the role of Berta. The following article announced the event:

Rossini’s opera was so popular, that it regularly spawned the creation of numerous transcriptions wherever it was performed, permitting music lovers to surround themselves at home with Rossini’s well-known melodies. Here are two examples from the contemporary press in London that pass in review two British transcriptions.

The popularity of *The Barber of Seville* has of course, continued to grow. Some may even recall the famous Warner Brothers Looney Tunes’ parody of the opera seen in the cartoon short, *Rabbit of Seville* (1950). For those who don’t, you’re in for a treat…

Finally, here is a 1925 recording of the celebrated baritone Riccardo Stracciari singing an excerpt from “Largo al Factorum,” from *The Barber of Seville*. We think it’s a “knockout”.
