American composer and jazz saxophonist John Coltrane was one of the most influential artists in jazz history. Coltrane’s music flows between mainstream accessibility and the avant-garde, as heard in his more than fifty recording sessions as a leader, and as a sideman for, among others, Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk.

Over the course of his career, Coltrane’s music took on a heightened spiritual dimension. Recorded in 1965 and released in 1966, the album *Ascension* represents a shining example of this spirituality, and his oeuvre more broadly, signaling a departure from more structured forms into an expanded, free jazz setting. This album is a continuous 40-minute performance with ensemble passages, without breaks. The eleven-piece ensemble was anchored by members of Coltrane’s “Classic Quartet”—McCoy Tyner on piano, Jimmy Garrison on bass, and Elvin Jones on drums—alongside a roster of then mostly young, up-and-coming horn players, including Freddie Hubbard, Pharoah Sanders, and Archie Shepp.

Gripped by this artistic and spiritual work, the avant-garde jazz journal *Change,* a product of the Detroit Artists’ Workshop, published, in its second issue, three reviews of *Ascension* written by avant-garde writer-poets. These writers attempted, in their own way, to encapsulate in words what Coltrane and his colleagues captured with sound.

Listen to *Ascension* as you read selected portions of these reviews.

He reviewed jazz recordings for *JazzTimes* and *Down Beat*, as well as founded his own jazz journal, *The Grackle: Improvised Music in Transition,* which was published in Brooklyn, New York from 1976 to 1979. He also coordinated the Jazz Oral History Project at the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers University.

Dave Sinclair is perhaps best known as the brother of John Sinclair, leader of the 1960s counterculture movement in Michigan, and organizer of radical social, political, and cultural endeavors primarily in the areas of music, poetry, graphic design, and community welfare projects. During the 1960s and 1970s John Sinclair founded or was active in a variety of political and cultural groups including the Artists’ Workshop in Detroit, which founded *Change,* and the White Panther Party. Dave was also the manager of The UP, a proto-punk rock band founded in 1967 which lived in John Sinclair’s commune.

Jerry (J. B.) Figi was a Chicago-based writer, poet, and jazz critic. In an obituary published in 1999, John Litweiler wrote, “He was not a prolific writer, but he certainly was an influential one. His work first began appearing in small magazines in the early 1960s. He also wrote for John and Leni Sinclair’s short-lived *Change*, which was devoted to the new jazz of the mid-’60s.” Figi would later serve as one of the directors for the Jazz Institute of Chicago, working on, amongst other things, the Chicago Jazz Festival.
