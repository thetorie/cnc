From November 10, 1833 to October 20, 1835, the Librarie J. Delacour in Meudon and Vaugirard published the French pedagogical music journal, *Le Pianiste*. In its first year of publication, the journal dealt only with issues related to the piano. Thereafter , it began covering the musical world at large, with concert reviews, anecdotes, and information about musical archives. The pianist and pedagogue, Charles Chaulieu was the only contributor who signed articles and, although there is no official mention that he was the journal’s editor, it is generally considered that Chaulieu fulfilled that role.

One of the interesting features of the journal is a series of portraits of well- and lesser-known pianists and pianist–composers. These illustrations appeared on the cover of its issues. The portraits were often accompanied by studies, with biographical notes, offering insights into the individual’s compositional talent, style, personalitiy, performance qualities, and pedagogical compositions. In all there are twenty four portraits, eight of which are reproduced below. Each is accompanied with a quote from the journal, translated into English, that helps define the manner in which the individual was viewed by his contemporaries. We thought you might enjoy seeing them.

J. N. Hummel (de Vienne) \[Lith. de J. Delacour à Vaugirard\] (1, 2, December 1833)

“He is the founder of the modern school. He is the today the greatest of composer pianists– which is not to be confused with the pianist composers.”

F. Kalkbrenner \[Lith. de Benard, rue de l’Abbaye 4\] (1, 3, January 1834)

“Look at Kalkbrenner, when he touches the piano… neither his body nor his face reflect the immense difficulties his fingers encounter. As a performer, Kalkbrenner stands as a model.”

![cramer](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Cramer.jpg)

J. B. Cramer \[Lith. de Benard\] (1, 4, February 1834)

“We can confidently give all of Cramer’s works to students; their fingers and ears will surely be well trained. This is a privilege not shared by many of today’s composers.”

![steinbelt](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Steinbelt.jpg)

D. Steinbelt \[Lith. de Benard\] (1, 6, April 1834)

“\[Steinbelt\] was the truly salon pianist: loved, adored by the women of the society, he knew how to cater to their pleasures. If he exhausted the form of a piece, he would find a new one, never waiting for us to lose interest.”

![herz](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Herz.jpg)

Henri Herz \[Lith. de Benard\] (1,7, May 1834)

Germany sends you this malicious mockery, from the *Gazette of Leipzig,* namely: “It is only the women without *esprit* and without talent that enjoy the music of H. Herz.”

![dussek](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Dussek.jpg)

J. L. Dussek \[Lith. de Benard\] (1, 10, August 1834)

“Today we select Dussek for our leaflet: the famous Dussek, so refined without softness, so educated without pedantry, and whose playing was, so to speak, as beautiful to watch as it was delightful to hear.”

![handel](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Handel.jpg)

G. F. Handel, né en 1682, mort en 1759 (1, 12, October 1834)

“The italians who possessed him for years, called him Handel *il Sassone* \[the Saxon\], and the English, with whom he remained for 47 years and for whom he composed all of his Oratorios with English words, considered him a compatriot.”

![haydn](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Haydn.jpg)

J. Haydn \[Impr. de J. Delacour à Vaugirard\] (2, 16, 1835)

“With a physiognomy a bit gruff and a kind of terseness when speaking, which would seem to indicate a coarse man, Haydn was cheerful, open minded and pleasant by nature. This vivacity was easily suppressed when he was in the company of strangers or of people of a superior rank.”
