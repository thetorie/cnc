Last week, we introduced [Gianni Viafora](https://www.ripm.org/cnc/?p=2617) and his “Gallery of Celebrities” in *Musical America*.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">[\[1\]](#_ftnref1)</span> Today we showcase his drawings of Puccini and Mascagni and compare them with contemporary photographs of the composers. We leave you to compare the skill and amusing refinement with which this all-but-forgotten artist depicts his subjects. We also include several texts from *Musical America*, a remarkable, though little-explored documentary resource, dealing with lesser-known elements of the composers’ lives. And, for the first time, we provide links to entire articles sampled below, no subscription required!

Giacomo Puccini  
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">24 Vol. No. 1 (22 July 1916): 7; Vol. 29 No. 8 (21 December 1918): 1.</span>

Note that Puccini is pictured lake-side, across from which is depicted his villa on Torre del Lago. Note also the tiny singing duck, perched on the end of the composer’s hunting rifle!

Puccini the Hunter  
“…duck shooting, which he pursued with more energy than his composing…”
