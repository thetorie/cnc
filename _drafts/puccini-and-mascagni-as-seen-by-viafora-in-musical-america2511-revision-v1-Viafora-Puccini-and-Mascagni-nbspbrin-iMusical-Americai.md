Last week, we introduced [Gianni Viafora](https://www.ripm.org/cnc/?p=2617) and his “Gallery of Celebrities” in *Musical America.* <span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Today we continue to showcase the work of this remarkable artist, “who is all but forgotten today, despite the fact that he was arguably the twentieth-century’s preeminent caricaturist of musicians,”<span style="font-size: 8pt;">[\[1\]](#_ftn1)</span> by featuring his drawings of two of the most famous Italian composers of the twentieth century, Giacomo Puccini and Pietro Mascagni. Accompanying these caricatures are contemporary photos of Puccini and Mascagni alongside the artist’s depiction of them, which allows one to appreciate the delicacy of his approach. We have also included a number of amusing texts from *Musical America* which we hope will offer insights into this extraordinarily rich and surprisingly little-explored documentary resource. And, for the first time, we have provided additional links where one can read the entire articles that are sampled below, without needing a subscription! </span></span>
