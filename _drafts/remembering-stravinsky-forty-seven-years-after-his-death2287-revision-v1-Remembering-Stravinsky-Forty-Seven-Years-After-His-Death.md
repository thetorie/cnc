April 6th was the 47th anniversary of the death of the composer Igor Stravinsky who first achieved international recognition for his three ballets commissioned by impresario Serge Diaghilev for the Ballets Russes: *The Firebird* (1910), *Petrushka* (1911), and *The Rite of Spring* (1913).

The French journal *Musica* published a favorable review of *The Firebird*, just several weeks after its premiere.

> The new work was, ultimately, the *Firebird*; which was the most important artistic event of this *Ballet Russe* season. It is an admirable spectacle … this tale danced in one act has an exceptional musical value. For that very reason, and especially for that reason, it deserves special mention.
> 
> A true dance music that remains nevertheless real music! … that is well worth being especially praised.
> 
> It reveals a young Russian composer of the greatest talent: Mr. Igor Stravinsky.

Nearly three years later, news of the raucous premiere of Stravinsky’s *The Rite of Spring* was reported throughout the musical press. Many reports comment on the composer’s dissonant score, including the translated review below, published in *Musical America*. The following illustration appeared the *Harvard Musical Review*, less than one year after the first performance of *The Rite of Spring*.

Two years later this photo appeared of an intense young Stravinsky in his studio in Petrograd.

In the same year, 1916, the following two short reviews of Stravinsky’s *Petrushka* describe how the composer’s music was being perceived in the United States.

Stravinsky then began moving towards what many call his “Neoclassical Period,” utilizing smaller chamber ensembles for works like *The Soldier’s Tale* (1918). The report below notes that this piece was unlike anything Stravinsky had previously composed.

Though Stravinsky’s musical style was changing, he continued to compose ballet music throughout his career, and maintained relationships with other collaborative artists. Pablo Picasso was one of, if not the, most famous visual artist with whom Stravinsky had close ties. The iconic artist even sketched Stravinsky on several occasions.

Russian avant-garde painter Michel Larionov also sketched Stravinsky along with a few of his colleagues as part of the Ballets Russes: impresario Serge Diaghilev, French writer, playwright, artist and film maker Jean Cocteau, and French composer Erik Satie.

Nine years after Larionov’s sketch was published in *Modern Music*, the journal published yet another sketch by Picasso, in 1934.
