April 6th was the 47th anniversary of the death of the composer Igor Stravinsky, who first achieved international recognition for his three ballets commissioned by impresario Serge Diaghilev for the Ballets Russes: *The Firebird* (1910), *Petrushka* (1911), and *The Rite of Spring* (1913).

The illustration below appeared in the *Harvard Musical Review* less than one year after the first performance of *The Rite of Spring*.

The French journal *Musica* published these comments after the premiere of *The Firebird*.

> The new work was, ultimately, the *Firebird*; which was the most important artistic event of this *Ballet Russe* season. It is an admirable spectacle … this tale danced in one act has exceptional musical value. For that very reason, and especially for that reason, it deserves special mention.
> 
> A true dance music that remains nevertheless real music! … that is well worth being especially praised.
> 
> It reveals a young Russian composer of the greatest talent: Mr. Igor Stravinsky.

Nearly three years later, news of the raucous premiere of Stravinsky’s *The Rite of Spring* was reported widely in the musical press. Many reports remarked on the composer’s dissonant score, including the following comments, published in *Musical America*.

 This photo of an intense young Stravinsky in his studio in Petrograd, appeared three years later.

In the same year, 1916, the following two short reviews of Stravinsky’s *Petrushka* demonstrate the reception of this work in the United States.

By 1918, Stravinsky had already composed a seminal work in what is referred to as his “Neoclassical Period,” utilizing a small chamber ensemble. Entitled *The Soldier’s Tale* (1918), it was described in the following report as being unlike anything Stravinsky had previously composed.

One of the artists with whom Stravinsky maintained a long term relationship was Pablo Picasso, who on several occasions, produced sketches of the composer.

Russian avant-garde painter Michel Larionov also sketched Stravinsky along with a few of his Ballets Russes colleagues, including the impresario Serge Diaghilev, French writer, playwright, artist and film maker Jean Cocteau, and French composer Erik Satie.

Nine years after Larionov’s sketch was published in *Modern Music*, the journal published yet another sketch of the composer by Picasso, in 1934.
