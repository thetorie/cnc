On today’s date in 1830, eleven-year-old Clara Wieck (later, Clara Schumann) gave her debut solo piano concert at the Leipzig Gewandhaus, sparking a career lasting more than sixty-years as both a distinguished performer and gifted composer.

We celebrate Wieck’s remarkable achievements with a portrait from her younger years published in the Parisian journal, [*Musica*](http://ripm.org/index.php?page=JournalInfo&ABB=MIA)*,* and two enthusiastic reviews of her debut. The first was published by the [*Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung*](http://ripm.org/index.php?page=JournalInfo&ABB=ALZ) \[AMZ\] and the second was a translated and condensed version of the original AMZ report, published in the London journal [*The Harmonicon*](http://ripm.org/index.php?page=JournalInfo&ABB=HAR)*.*
