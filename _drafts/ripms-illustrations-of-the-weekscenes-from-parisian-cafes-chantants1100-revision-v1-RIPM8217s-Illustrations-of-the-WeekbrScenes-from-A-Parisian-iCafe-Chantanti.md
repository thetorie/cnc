Have you ever wondered what it would be like to walk the streets of Paris in the 19<sup>th-</sup>century? You are strolling along the cobblestone streets, taking in the sights and sounds, when suddenly a song by Aristide Bruant catches your ear. Enticed, you follow the sounds into a dimly-lit room and hear this:

###### ![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/1-cafe-bruant.jpg)*Musica,* Vol. 7 No. 74 (November 1908): 167.

<div style="text-align: center;">The seven images depicting scenes in c*afés chantants* were published on 6 December 1851 in *L’Illustration,* the first illustrated newsweekly in France. Between 1843 and 1899, the journal published over 3,350 engravings of musical interest, offering an expansive visual account of musical activities in 19<sup>th</sup>-century Europe. We will continue to feature a number of illustrations from this journal in the weeks ahead.
