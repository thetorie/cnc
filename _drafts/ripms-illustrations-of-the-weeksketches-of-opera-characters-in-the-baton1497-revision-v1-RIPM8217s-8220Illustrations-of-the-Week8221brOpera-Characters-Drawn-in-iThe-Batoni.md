*The Baton* (1922-32) was published by the Institute of Musical Art in New York City. In 1924, the Juilliard Graduate School opened, with its facilities directly adjacent to the Institute. By 1926 the two music schools merged although both continued to maintain their own administrations until 1946, when they officially unified as the Juilliard School of Music.

A charming addition to *The Baton* is a number of drawings by pianist, writer, and artist Leslie Fairchild. Particularly interested in circus life, Fairchild’s art featured in the Ringling Museum of the American Circus in Sarasota, Fla.; the Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wis., and the Barnum Museum in Bridgeport. As a young piano student, Fairchild incorporated musical symbols into a style of simple lines and shapes, adding a touch of whimsy to the journal’s written material. The journal announced his future contributions in a March 1923 issue.
