Editor (Baltimore): *To date, RIPM offers access to some 291 full-text searchable music periodicals, to over 1.1 million full-text pages online and to some 901,000 annotated citations. Over the past three years, RIPM’s Associate Editor Nicoletta Betta has presented a paper dealing with RIPM’s recently completed and current indexing projects at the annual congress of the International Association of Music Libraries, Archives, and Documentation Centres (IAML, held respectively in New York, 2015; Rome, 2016; and Riga, 2017).*

*Today we continue with the second installment of this series.*

<span style="font-size: 18pt;">\* \* \*</span>

In 2016, fourteen journals were indexed and will be available in the Retrospective Index, along with, in most cases, the full-text of the indexed titles.

In my presentation, I will present basic publication information for all periodicals, the name of the RIPM editor or collaborator responsible for its indexing, and then select one or more journals for discussion, explaining why they were selected for inclusion in RIPM. For clarity, the journals are grouped by country of publication.

RIPM collaborators Peter Sühring (Berlin) and Alexander Staub (Leipzig) continued indexing the monumental *Neue Zeitschrift für Musik* (NZM) by expanding its index to include the “Kleine Zeitung” (little newspaper), a section dedicated to reporting on musical life in Germany. This column, which expanded in length and content year after year, regularly contains information about concerts, tours of composers and performers, obituaries, music festivals, and new opera productions. After indexing the “Kleine Zeitung” sections, Sühring and Staub indexed the “Tagesgeschichte” (daily history) and “Vermischtes” (miscellaneous) sections. The *Neue Zeitschrift für Musik* is currently available in the Retrospective Index to Music Periodicals with Full Text from the years 1834 to 1859.

\* \* \*

Two Viennese publications were also treated: Peter Sühring indexed *Musikalischer Kurier* (Vienna, 1919-22); and Alexander Staub, *Musikbote* (Vienna, 1924-26).

Edited by Max Graf, a pupil of Eduard Hanslick and Anton Bruckner, *Musikalischer Kurier* typified the complex nature of post-World War I Austria, by reflecting both the desire to preserve the old values of Austro-German musical culture and the need to accept modernist ideas. Below is the cover of the special August 1921 issue, which contains writings on the then-new Salzburg Festival.

Collaborator David Sommerfield (Washington, D.C.) completed the index to the English-language journal, *Opera Magazine* (New York, 1914-16). This periodical focused on bolstering a distinctly American musical identity by reporting on musical events in this country, such as opera productions, and repertoire as well as singers. Alongside the sample cover below is a photo of Léonide Massine, Leon Bakst, and Igor Stravinsky from the 1916 American tour of the Ballets Russes.

Four Italian journals have been indexed; three by RIPM collaborator Elvidio Surian (Pesaro, Italy) and I indexed *Rassegna Musicale*.

The monumental *Musica d’Oggi,* with a publication run of over forty years, represented something new for the influential Milan publishing house, Ricordi. While Ricordi’s previous periodicals were mainly informative bulletins, *Musica d’Oggi* was more scholarly, focusing principally on contemporary music.

<div style="text-align: center;">An article in *Musica d’Oggi* dedicated to the namesake of the Ricordi publishing house on its 150th anniversary  
<span style="font-size: 70%;">Vol. 1 No. 1 (January 1958): 5. </span></div><div style="text-align: center;">* * *</div>*La Melodia* had a brief publication life, and was printed in an older newspaper-style layout. Generally, its content included information about local music events and Italian musical life, as well as numerous music examples.

\* \* \*

Each issue of *L’Arte pianistica,* published in Napoli, included a biographical article of a distinguished musical figure. Below is just an example, that of the medieval music theorist Guido D’Arezzo.

\* \* \*

RIPM’s Editor of French periodicals Doris Pyee (Bordeaux) indexed the Belgian journal *Sirène* (Brussels, 1937-46; title changed during publication to *Syrinx*) and the French title, *Le Domaine musical* (Paris, 1954).

*Sirène* was founded by a group of young Belgian composers, which included Albert Huybrechts, Marcel Poot, Fernand Quinet, and André Souris. While primarily an informative bulletin about these composers’ activities, the journal also contained information about new music produced abroad, music bibliography, concerts, radio programs, and recordings. Its cover displays a distinctly modern design.

\* \* \*

*Le Domaine musical* focused on contemporary music. It was founded by the late composer and conductor Pierre Boulez, and includes contributions from influential composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen. The journal also contains photographs, including the one below of Stockhausen’s experimental music studio in Köln, Germany.

\* \* \*

Finally, RIPM added one Argentinian, one Chilean, and two Russian journals. Gabriel Caballero (New York) indexed *Revista de Musica* (Buenos Aires, 1927-28, 1930) and *Musica Chile* (Santiago, 1920-23) and collaborator Natalia Ostroumova (Moscow) treated *Russian musical vestnik* (1880-82) and *Muzikal’naya nov* (1923-24), both published in Moscow.

The main aim of *La Revista de Musica* was to inform local music amateurs about events happening abroad: the decline of the tonal system, the flourishing of new harmonic theories, the birth of new media, as well as the tours of Western artists visiting Argentina.
