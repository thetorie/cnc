*Over the past three years, RIPM’s Associate Editor Nicoletta Betta has presented on our then current indexing projects at the annual congress of the International Association of Music Libraries, Archives, and Documentation Centres (IAML). Our team of dedicated staff and collaborators continues to work with remarkable pace and efficiency, upholding the tradition of RIPM’s flagship Retrospective Index, described as “fulfilling a dream of productivity that is virtually unprecedented in the field of music scholarship” (reviewer, National Endowment for the Humanities). And with the recent release of the RIPM Retrospective Index to Music Periodicals with Full Text, a combination of the RIPM Retrospective Index and the RIPM Online Archive to Music Periodicals, users now have access to over 260 rare music journals, 170 of which are available in full-text.*

*In this three part series, we provide extracts from Betta’s presentations, highlighting newly indexed journals that are either forthcoming or have been recently published and are now available.*

In 2016, fourteen journals were indexed and will be available in the Retrospective Index, along with, in most cases, the full-text of the indexed titles.

In my presentation, I will present basic publication information for all periodicals, the name of the RIPM editor or collaborator responsible for its indexing, and then select one or more publications for discussion, indicating important features to explain why it was added to the RIPM series. For clarity, the journals are grouped by language of publication.

Collaborators Peter Sühring and Alexander Staub continue to index the monumental *Neue Zeitschrift für Musik* (Leipzig, 1834-today) by developing a new indexing procedure.

Each issue of this journal contains a column dedicated to German musical life. This section, “Kleine Zeitung” (little newspaper), expands year after year, adding information about concerts and tours of composers and performers, obituaries, music festivals, new operas, and more. It soon became clear that the amount of information included in this column needed to be treated in detail. Once the “Kleine Zeitung” sections were completed, Sühring and Staub also similarly indexed the sections “Tagesgeschichte” (daily history) and “Vermischtes” (miscellaneous). The *Neue Zeitschrift für Musik* is currently available in the Retrospective Index to Music Periodicals with Full Text from the years 1834 to 1854.

Two publications from Vienna were also treated by our frequent collaborators; Peter Sühring indexed *Musikalischer Kurier* (Vienna, 1919-1922), now available in full text, and Alexander Staub treated *Musikbote* (Vienna, 1924-1926), currently available as an annotated index.

Edited by Max Graf, a pupil of Eduard Hanslick and Anton Bruckner, *Musikalischer Kurier* typified the Janus-faced nature of post-World War I Austria, reflecting both the desire to preserve the old values of Austro-German musical culture and the need to accept modernist ideas. Below is the cover of the special August 1921 issue, “Salzburg,” containing contributions dealing with the realization of the new Salzburg Festival.

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Vol. 3 Nos. 31-35 (August 1921).</span>

Collaborator David Sommerfield completed the index to our one English-language journal, *Opera Magazine* (New York, 1914-1916).

A journal rich in photographic documentation, *Opera Magazine* focused on bolstering a distinctly American musical identity through the promotion of American opera productions, singers, and repertoire. Accompanying the sample cover below is a photo of Léonide Massine, Leon Bakst, and Igor Stravinsky from the 1916 American tour of the Ballets Russes.

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Vol. 3 No. 3 (March 1916): 15.</span>

Four Italian-language journals have been treated; three were produced by RIPM’s collaborator of long standing: Elvidio Surian. I am responsible for the continued indexing to *Rassegna Musicale*.

*Musica d’Oggi* represented a new course in the journals issued by the influential Milan publishing house, Ricordi: while previous magazines were mainly informative bulletins, *Musica d’Oggi* was more scholarly, focusing principally on contemporary music.

<div style="text-align: center;">An article in *Musica d’Oggi* dedicated to the namesake of the Ricordi publishing house on its 150th anniversary  
<span style="font-size: 70%;">Vol. 1 No. 1 (January 1958): 5.</span></div>Unlike *Musica d’Oggi*, *La Melodia* had a brief publication life, and exemplified the older typology of music journals; its pagination following the style of newspapers and its content, generally, provided information about local music events and musical life. Music examples were regularly included.

Each issue of *L’Arte pianistica* includes a biographical article of a distinguished composer or performer, ranging from the Medieval Period to the 20th century. Below is one such feature: Guido D’Arezzo.

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/10-IAML-2016.jpg)<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Vol. 1 No. 24 (15 December 1914.</span>

RIPM’s Editor of French periodicals Doris Pyee indexed the Belgian journal *Sirène* (Bruxelles, 1937-1946; title changed during publication to *Syrinx*) and the French journal, *Le Domaine musical* (Paris, 1954), which is now available as an annotated index.

*Sirène* was founded by a group of young Belgian composers, which included Albert Huybrechts, Marcel Poot, Fernand Quinet, and André Souris. The journal was an informative bulletin about these composers’ activities, but also contained information about new music produced abroad. It gave particular attention to music bibliography, concert and radio programmes, and recordings.

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/12-IAML-2016.jpg)<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Issue 1 (March 1937).</span>

*Le Domaine musical* was a modern music journal founded by Pierre Boulez and includes a photo, reprodced below, of an experimental music studio in Köln founded by Karlheinz Stockhausen, a regular contributor to the journal.

![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/14-IAML-2016.jpg)<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Issue 1 (1954): \[1p\] 128/129.</span>

Two Spanish-language journals have been indexed by collaborator Gabriel Caballero, *Revista de Musica* from Argentina (Buenos Aires, 1927-1928, 1930) and *Musica Chile* (Santiago, 1920-1923).

*La Revista de Musica*‘s main aim was to inform Argentine music amateurs about events happening abroad: the decline of the tonal system and the flourishing of new harmonic theories, the birth of new media, as well as the tours of Western artists visiting Argentina.

Finally, two Russian-language journals have been indexed by collaborator Natalia Ostroumova: *Russian musical vestnik* and *Muzikal’naya nov*, both published in Moscow.
