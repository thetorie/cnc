*The International Association of Music Libraries, Archives, and Documentation Centres (IAML) held its 2015 congress at the Juilliard School in New York, USA, in conjunction with the International Musicological Society (IMS). At the gathering, on 25 June 2015, RIPM’s Associate Editor Nicoletta Betta spoke about our then current indexing projects.*

Over the past year, twenty-three journals were indexed and will be available in the Retrospective Index, along with, in most cases, the full-text of the indexed titles.

In my presentation, I will present basic publication information for all periodicals, the name of the RIPM editor or collaborator responsible for its indexing, and then select one or more publications for discussion, indicating important features to explain why it was added to the RIPM series. For clarity, the journals are grouped by country of publication.

RIPM collaborators Peter Sühring and Alexander Staub have made significant progress in our ongoing indexing project of the *Neue Zeitschrift für Musik*, focusing on the so-called “Brendel years,” from 1845 to 1868. After assuming ownership from Robert Schumann in 1844, Franz Brendel continued to publish the journal as an alternative to the *Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung*. By the late 1850s, he began using the publication to promote the ideas of the New German School—the *Neudeutsche Schule*—a term he himself introduced.

Nine English-language journals from the United States and have been indexed by number of RIPM staff members, including Senior Editor Richard Kitson, Managing Associate Director Benjamin Knysak, Publications Manager Justin Nurin, as well as collaborators Ruth Henderson, Mary Davidson, and David Sommerfield.

Interestingly, two publications—*International Music &amp; Drama* and *Music* *and Musicians/Musica e Musicisti*—are published both in English and in Italian, requiring additional indexing by longstanding collaborator Elvidio Surian, as well as myself.

The bi-lingual format of *International Music &amp; Drama* and *Music and Musicians/Musica e Musicisti* was designed to effectively report on Italian musical life for Italian immigrant communities in the United States. These journals also regularly followed the events of World War I, as well as the immigration status of European singers, musicians and composers.

RIPM’s collaborator Elvidio Surian and I have collectively indexed six Italian-language journals this year.

*Musica e Scena* was published by the influential Milan-based publishing house, Sonzogno. This journal contains numerous photographs of opera scenes and portraits of singers and composers, particularly those representing the Italian *Giovane scuola* (Young School) of composers: Ruggero Leoncavallo, Pietro Mascagni, Umberto Giordano and Giacomo Puccini.

*Incontri Musicali* had a short publication life–only four issues between 1956 and 1960–but included contributions from some of most influential European composers of the 20th century. Founded by Luciano Berio, it was dedicated to contemporary music—electronic, serial, and aleatoric, specifically—and contains articles by Henri Pousseur, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Umberto Eco, and John Cage.

Three French-language journals, all published in Paris during the first half of 20th century, were indexed by RIPM Editor of French Periodicals, Doris Pyee.

*Musique* was a continuation of the journal *Revue Pleyel*, edited by musicologist Marc Pincherle. It contains reports on new media—contemporary music recordings and radio broadcasts of concerts—as well as a vast array of correspondences on musical life from around the world. In fact, it was one of the first journals to publish correspondences from Japan.

RIPM also added one journal from England, one from Mexico, and two from Russia, indexed by Richard Kitson and RIPM collaborators Gabriel Caballero and Natalia Ostroumova, respectively.

*El Sonido 13* was founded by Mexican composer Julian Carrillo, a Nobel Prize laureate for his studies on acoustics and microtones. This journal was dedicated to promoting contemporary Mexican music, and in turn, as an outward rejection of dominant European musical trends.
