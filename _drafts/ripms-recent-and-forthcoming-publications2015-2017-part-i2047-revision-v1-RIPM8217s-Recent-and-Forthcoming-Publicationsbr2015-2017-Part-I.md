To date, we have included only Curios and Chronicles in this publication. Today we focus for the first time on News items related to RIPM. Next week we will return to Curios with an interesting and ongoing feature.

<u>Editor (Baltimore):</u> *Today, RIPM offers access to some 280 full-text searchable music periodicals (over 1,000,000+ full-text pages online) and some 875,000 annotated citations. Over the past three years, RIPM’s Associate Editor Nicoletta Betta has presented a paper dealing with RIPM’s recently completed and current indexing projects at the annual congress of the International Association of Music Libraries, Archives, and Documentation Centres (IAML, held respectively in New York, 2015; Rome, 2016; and Riga, 2017).*

*This series is in three parts, the first of which follows.*

<u>Nicoletta Betta (Turino):</u> In 2015, twenty-three journals were indexed and will be available in the Retrospective Index, along with, in most cases, the full-text of the indexed titles.

In my presentation, I will present basic publication information for all periodicals, the name of the RIPM editor or collaborator responsible for its indexing, and then select one or more journals for discussion, explaining why they were selected for treatment by RIPM. For clarity, the journals are grouped by country of publication.

RIPM collaborators Peter Sühring (Berlin) and Alexander Staub (Leipzig) have made significant progress in our ongoing indexing of the *Neue Zeitschrift für Musik*, focusing this time on the so-called “Brendel years,” from 1845 to 1868. After assuming ownership of the journal from Robert Schumann in 1844, Franz Brendel continued to publish content that set it off as an alternative to the [*Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung*](https://ripm.org/?page=JournalInfo&ABB=ALZ). By the late 1850s, Brendel began therein promoting the ideas of the New German School—the *Neudeutsche Schule*—a term he himself introduced. Currently, the *Neue Zeitschrift für Musik* is available in the Retrospective Index to Music Periodicals with Full Text from the years 1834 to 1854.

Nine English-language journals published in the United States were indexed by a number of RIPM staff members (Baltimore): Senior Editor Richard Kitson; Managing Associate Director Benjamin Knysak; Publications Manager Justin Nurin, as well as collaborators Ruth Henderson (New York), Mary Davidson, and David Sommerfield (Washington, D.C.).

Interestingly, two publications—*International Music &amp; Drama,* and Musicians/Musica e Musicisti*—are published both in English and in Italian, requiring additional indexing by longstanding collaborator Elvidio Surian (Pesaro, Italy) and RIPM’s Associate Editor.

<span style="font-size: 70%;">Vol. 4 No. 2 (18 January 1918).</span>

The bi-lingual format of *International Music &amp; Drama,* and *Music and Musicians/Musica e Musicisti* was designed to report on Italian musical life for Italian immigrant communities in the United States. These journals also regularly followed the events of World War I, as well as the immigration status of European singers, musicians, and composers.

RIPM’s collaborator Elvidio Surian and I have collectively indexed six Italian-language journals this year.

*Musica e Scena* was published by the influential Milan-based publishing house, Sonzogno. This journal contains numerous photographs of opera scenes and portraits of singers and composers, particularly those representing the Italian *Giovane scuola* (Young School) of composers: Ruggero Leoncavallo, Pietro Mascagni, Umberto Giordano and Giacomo Puccini.

Despite its short publication run of only four issues between 1956 and 1960, *Incontri Musicali’s* contributors include a number of well-known twentieth-century composers. Founded by Luciano Berio, *Incontri Musicali* was dedicated to contemporary music—electronic, serial, and aleatoric, specifically—and contains articles by, among others, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Ernest Krenek, Henri Pousseur and John Cage.

Three French-language journals, all published in Paris during the first half of the twentieth century, were indexed by RIPM Editor of French Periodicals, Doris Pyee (Bordeaux).

Edited by musicologist Marc Pincherle, and a continuation of the journal *Revue Pleyel, Musique* contains reports on new media—contemporary music recordings and radio broadcasts of concerts—and a great deal of correspondence on musical life from numerous locations. In fact, the journal was one of the first to publish correspondences from Japan.

RIPM also added one U.K., one Mexican, and two Russian journals, indexed respectively by Richard Kitson, Gabriel Caballero (New York), and Natalia Ostroumova (Moscow).

*El Sonido 13* was founded by Mexican composer Julian Carrillo, a Nobel Prize laureate for his studies on acoustics and microtones. This journal was dedicated to promoting contemporary Mexican music, and reflected an outward rejection of dominant European musical trends.
