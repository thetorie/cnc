Reinach would eventually work with Gabriel Fauré to compose a new accompaniment before he presented his results to the members of the Association pour l’Encouragement des Études Grecques en France. The first public performance, without Fauré’s accompaniment, was given on March 26, 1894 at a soirée given by the French School, in the presence of King George I and Queen Olga of Greece. *The Musical News* was not so enthusiastic about the discovery and first performance of the hymn…

In the same month, T*he Musical Times* went as far as to call it “the most important musical ‘find’ of the nineteenth century,” and it included the hymn in modern musical notation in an extra supplement of one of its issues.

An analytical article appeared three years after the discovery of the hymn.
