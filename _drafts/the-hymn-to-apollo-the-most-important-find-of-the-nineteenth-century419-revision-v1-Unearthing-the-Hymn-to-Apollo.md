In May 1893, the École Française d’Athènes unearthed, at the Athenian Treasury in Delphi, one of the oldest surviving musical compositions. The discovery sparked great interest and contributed to a revival of ancient Greek music in the late nineteenth century, particularly in France. Composers like Felix Mendelssohn, Claude Debussy, and Camille Saint-Saëns borrowed material and found inspiration in ancient hellenic sources, but in this month’s *Curious, News, and Chronicles* we will focus on Gabriel Faure’s arrangement of the first Delphic hymn.

Soon after Otto Crusius, Henri Weil, and Theodore Reinach restored, analyzed, and transcribed the hymn, news and articles of the discovery widely circulated throughout scholarly journals, newspapers, and the musical press. Reinach would eventually work with Gabriel Fauré to compose a new accompaniment before he presented his results to the members of the Association pour l’Encouragement des Études Grecques en France. The first public performance, without Fauré’s accompaniment, was given on March 26, 1894 at a soiree given by the French School, in the presence of King George I and Queen Olga of Greece. *The Musical News* was not so enthusiastic about the discovery and first performance of the hymn…

In the same month, T*he Musical Times* went as far as to call it “the most important musical ‘find’ of the nineteenth century,” and it included the hymn in modern musical notation as an extra supplement in one of his issues.

Detailed and analytical articles continued to appear three years after the discovery of the hymn. Music: a monthly magazine published a translated version of an article originally written by the Czech Ludvik Keba, in which he discussed hymn discovery, first performances, and the difficulties of deciphering ancient greek music, given the very few
