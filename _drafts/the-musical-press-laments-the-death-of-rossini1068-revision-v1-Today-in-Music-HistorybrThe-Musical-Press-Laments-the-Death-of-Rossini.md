A portrait of Rossini published one year before his passing

On 13 November 1868, 149 years ago today, Italian Gioachino Rossini—composer of more than three dozen operas, including the canonic *opera buffa*, [*The Barber of Seville*](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/?p=345)—died in Paris at the age of eighty-six. Though retiring from opera composition in 1829, nearly four decades before his passing, the success of Rossini’s prolific early years made him a widely renowned public figure. This popularity is reflected in the attention given to his death in the musical press, with many journals reporting the news on their front pages.

As music periodicals from around the Western world eulogized the composer for several weeks, the Parisian illustrated newsweekly, *L’Illustration,* visually documented Rossini’s funeral proceedings. As indicative of his widespread adoration, much of Paris attended.

<u>RIPM search tip</u>: For more on Rossini’s death, first, in both RIPM’s Retrospective Index and *e*-Library of Music Periodicals, set the span of years in the “Date” field from “1868 to 1869”. This limits one’s search to the year of his death and one year following. Then, search “Rossini” as a keyword.
