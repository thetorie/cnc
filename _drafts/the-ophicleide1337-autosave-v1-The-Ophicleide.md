What do Hector Berlioz, Felix Mendelssohn, Giuseppe Verdi, Sir Arthur Sullivan, and Richard Wagner have in common? They all composed for the ophicleide! Patented in 1821 by French instrument maker Jean Hilaire Asté, the ophicleide was used in military bands and orchestras well into the 20<sup>th</sup>-century, though it has now been largely superseded by the tuba. Moreover, author, composer, and organist Dr. Orlando Mansfield described this instrument as “ugly” and “curious” in a 1929 issue of *The New Music Review and Church Music Review.*

Hector Berlioz wrote briefly about the ophicleide in his *Grand traité d’instrumentation et d’orchestration modernes.* This text was later translated and reprinted in *Dwight’s Journal of Music.*

Berlioz selected this “monstrous” “bull” of an instrument to feature prominently in the fifth movement of his *Symphonie fantastique.* When paired with its bass wind instrument cousin, the serpent, the duo creates an ominous atmosphere when performing the Medieval Latin hymn, “Dies Irae”. Let’s listen to it.

In fact, the effort required to produce a sound on the instrument even led some to speculate that it could cause health problems.

While the ophicleide may have developed a reputation for being unwieldy and odd, a small community of musicians continues to perform on this unusual instrument. Some, like the Sydney Ophicleide Quartet, achieve an admirable level of tonal beauty and virtuosity.
