A frequent debate in the late nineteenth-century musical press concerned the purpose and style of program notes. Should these texts be educational, providing historical information and scientific (musicological) analysis? Or should they be interpretative, offering the listener a corresponding narrative, a mental journey to aid the listener’s appreciation of a work? Should the notes have any relation at all to the work they describe? We see this in the example below, in which William Smyth Babcock Matthews (editor of *Music: A Monthly Magazine*) cites the American music critic, Phillip Hale, for his criticism of the overly analytical programs of the Boston Symphony (written by William F. Apthorp).

“The Plains: Ode Symphonie, par Jabez Tarbox”, the writing cited by Hale in his criticism of Apthorp’s unduly analytical, illustrative program notes was a peculiar, well-received and often-cited satire written by the American humorist George H. Derby (better known by his noms de plume “John Phoenix” and “John P. Squibob”). For those who have not had the distinct pleasure of reading it, we offer it in this month’s *Curious, News, and Chronicles*.

Although most of Derby’s satires were not musical matters, they were often re-published by the musical press for amusement.
