Accompanied by his wife and children, Antonin Dvořák arrived in America on 27 September 1892 to assume the directorship of the National Conservatory of Music in New York City. Soon after this much anticipated event, Boston’s *Musical Herald* reprinted a review of the composer’s welcome concert by music critic H. E Krehbiel, originally written for the *New York Tribune.* At the concert, Dvořák’s compositions and conducting were featured.
