A portrait by Adolphe Mouilleron of Rossini, one year before his passing

On today’s date in 1868, 149 years ago, Gioachino Rossini—composer of more than three dozen operas, including the ever-popular *opera buffa*, [*The Barber of Seville*](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/?p=345)—died in Paris at the age of seventy-six. Though retiring from opera composition in 1829, nearly four decades before his passing, the success of Rossini’s prolific early years made him a widely renowned public figure. This popularity is reflected in the attention given to his death in the musical press, with many journals reporting the news on their front pages. Here are some examples.

As eulogies of the composer appeared in the press, the Parisian illustrated newsweekly, *L’Illustration,* visually documented Rossini’s funeral proceedings. As indicative of his widespread adoration, much of Paris attended.

Lowering of the coffin into the vault of the city, in Père-Lachaise Cemetery

> *Rossini was sought out and courted, not merely on account of his fame as a composer, but for his wit, his humour, his amiability, and general goodness. With him has departed one of the most remarkable geniuses and one of the kindliest spirits of the nineteenth century.*

*The Musical World,* Vol. 46 No. 47 (21 November 1868): 789.


<u>RIPM search tip</u>: For more on Rossini’s death, first, in both RIPM’s Retrospective Index and *e*-Library of Music Periodicals, set the span of years in the “Date” field from “1868 to 1869”. This limits one’s search to the year of his death and one year following. Then, search “Rossini” as a keyword.
