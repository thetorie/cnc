From 1933 to 1945, the period of Nazi Germany, a number of prominent European composers fled their homelands and sought refuge in the United States. Many were subjects of interest in the American journal *Modern Music* (New York, 1924-1946). Sketches by Viennese artist Benedikt Fred Dolbin (a pen name for Fred Pollack), a composition student of Arnold Schoenberg, include some of the most well-known composers of the period. After establishing a successful career drawing for a number of Austrian and German publications–including *Der Wiener Tag, Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung,* and *Berliner Tageblatt*–Dolbin, of Jewish descent, received a *Berufsverbot* order, which prohibited his artwork from appearing in the German press. Soon after, Dolbin, like the composers he sketched below, emigrated to America.
