<span style="font-size: 10pt;">*Musikalischer Kurier,* vol. 2 no. 44 (29 October 1920): \[405\].</span>

French composer, pianist, and conductor Maurice Ravel was born 143 years ago today, on 7 March 1875. The musical press published a number of interesting reviews throughout the early 20th century of his then recently premiered works. Today, we pay tribute to Ravel by sharing from our archives a few of these reviews.

Ravel completed his famous *String Quartet in F Major* at the age of 28. The New York premiere of this work was reviewed in the journal, *The New Music Review and Church Music Review*.

A 1909 painting of Ravel by Achille Ouvré  
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">*Bulletin français de la Société Internationale de Musique (S.I.M),* vol. 6 no. 8 (Aug.-Sept. 1910): xxvi.</span>

</div>In 1912, less than one year after the piece’s premiere, Ravel’s acerbic *Huit valses nobles et sentimentales* was reviewed evocatively in the *Bulletin français de la Société Internationale de Musique*.

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">*![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/15-Ravel.jpg)*</span>

> Monsieur Ravel will forgive us if we confess to him that his *Eight valses nobles et sentimentales* make us irresistibly think of some exotic fruits: we grit our teeth when we bite into it for the first time: we return by curiosity, then by pleasure, and finally we end up loving them more than all the others: we are still in the period of mistrust.

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">*Bulletin français de la Société Internationale de Musique (S.I.M),* vol. 8 no. 2 (15 February 1912): 76.</span>

<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WVYLjakSwnc?rel=0&start=4&end=107" width="560"><span class="mce_SELRES_start" data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;">﻿</span></iframe>

</div>Unsurprisingly, as with this 1910 review of his *Rhapsodie Espagnole* below, Ravel’s harmonic language and orchestration likened comparisons to the compositions of fellow Frenchman, Claude Debussy.

</div>While some works by Ravel were received with mixed responses, others were hailed as immediate masterpieces. One such case was *Boléro.* Soon after its 1928 premiere, the piece was reviewed in the American journal *Modern Music* by Henry Prunières, a musicologist and founder of the French music journal, *La Revue musicale.*
