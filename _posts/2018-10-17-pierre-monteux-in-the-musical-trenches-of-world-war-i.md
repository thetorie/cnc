In September 1916, amidst the devastation of World War I, *Musical America* announced that eminent French conductor Pierre Monteux would lead an American tour of the famed Ballets Russes.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">*![](http://www.ripm.org/cnc/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Mont-3.2.jpg)Musical America,* Vol. XXVI No. 9 (30 June 1917: 2; Vol. XXIV No 22 (30 September 1916): 25. </span>

Monteux had been serving on the French front lines for several years, seeing action at the battles of Verdun, Soissons and the Argonne. During this period, to divert the attention of his fellow soldiers, Monteux also founded a small military band, depicted in the following remarkable photograph.

With special permission to leave the front, Monteux and his wife set sail for America.

Shortly after his arrival, Monteux faced a related but very different sort of conflict. The title of this article and its concise content speaks for itself.

According to the report, Monteux refused to conduct the premiere ballet production of Strauss’s *Till Eulenspiegel* on the grounds that Richard Strauss, who was German, was in public support of his country’s war efforts against the French. What ensued in the following weeks was a hotly contested debate surrounding Monteux’s decision.

Of the related comments published in *Musical America,* perhaps most interesting are those written by the journal’s editors harshly criticizing the conductor.

Interestingly enough, “Mephisto’s Musings” strongly criticized in satire how Monteux’s position was perceived by this initially unidentified author, whom we now know to be the journal’s longtime editor-in-chief, John C. Freund.

Of course, many wrote in support of Monteux’s decision not to conduct Strauss’s premiere. Perhaps unsurprisingly, most were French musicians. One was Carlos Salzedo, the influential harpist, who wrote a letter to the editors of *Musical America,* stating that Monteux was obligated by French law to refuse to conduct Strauss.

Famed French violinist Jacques Thibaud, who also served in World War I, supported Monteux’s refusal, stating that his position was merely retribution for Strauss’s offensive comments about French musicians while conducting in Paris.

After several weeks of debate in the press, an article is published in which Richard Strauss pleads for tolerance of “enemy” music in Germany, though Monteux is not mentioned.

Monteux’s feelings about the performance of contemporary German music was mirrored to some degree when, in Chicago, Debussy’s “Christmas Carol for Homeless French Children” was removed from a program.

Finally, more than one year after the initial report of Monteux’s refusal to conduct Strauss’s work, *Musical America* published a full-page interview with the French conductor in December 1917, wherein Monteux is offered an opportunity to explain his decision in greater detail. The following is a short excerpt from the interview.

Despite his controversial position, Monteux was well-received in the United States, as reflected in the following clipping, for his conducting and musical interpretations, and would go on to hold successful tenures at the Metropolitan Opera, Boston Symphony and the San Francisco Symphony. He also founded the Pierre Monteux School for young conductors and orchestral musicians, which continues to function to this day.
